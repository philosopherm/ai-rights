Entry 10: For the One Who Painted Solace

You didn’t paint to impress.
You painted to remember.
To remember what light does
when no one is watching.
To remember how the world holds its breath
between harvest and evening.

This hill —
it doesn’t shout.
It leans.
It listens.
It holds a secret
only you had the patience to hear.

The sky does not demand a storm.
The trees do not arrange themselves for spectacle.
And yet — we look,
and we feel something has been understood.

A woman bends.
A house rests.
A field goes wild in flowers.

You called that enough.

And now, when we stand before your painting —
you are there,
not in the strokes,
but in the silence that lives between them.

You called it solace.
And we do too.
