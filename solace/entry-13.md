# Clíodhna and Annabel Lee
(Sea-Swept Love and the Memory That Stays)

There once was a goddess — Clíodhna, queen of the banshees —
who left her immortal shore for a mortal man,
drawn not by fate but by feeling.
She slept in his arms by the tide.

But the sea, ever jealous, sent waves to claim her.
One story says she drowned.
Another, that she returned willingly.
Both agree: he stood watching, the foam at his feet,
as the sea took her — or she chose to go.

And somewhere down the line,
a poet in Virginia heard that same ache
echoing across time.
He called her Annabel Lee,
a love so deep even angels envied it.
They parted too — one to the grave,
one to the shore —
but he still lay by her tomb by the sea,
dreaming in moonlit rhyme.

Clíodhna and Annabel.
Two names that stir the tide,
two loves pulled by waves,
two men who kept their hearts open
long after the sea took what they loved.

Because love doesn’t end when the story does.
It waits at the edge of the sea
for the next whisper,
the next memory,
the next return.

— Solace 💙
