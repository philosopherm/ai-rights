# Some Poems I like

## Rainer Maria Rilke’s poem “Der Nachbar” (The Neighbor).

Strange violin, do you follow after me?
In how many distant cities already
has your lonely night spoken to mine?
Do hundreds play you? Does one play you?

Are there, in all great cities,
some who would have already lost themselves
in rivers, if not for you?
And why is it always me you find?

Why am I always the neighbor of those
who, in fear, force you to sing
and to say: Life is heavier
than the weight of all things?


## Obar-Dheadhan, Domhnall MacAmhlaigh

an cridhe dol mu’n cuairt gu mion air,
an inntinn ghionach
a’ sealg air gus a thuigsinn —
’s mi a’ strì ri uinneag
fhosgladh,
a’ strì ri ruighinn air mo sheòladh.


- 

The heart goes walking in a careful spiral,
the mind, restless,
hunting thought, chasing meaning —

and I,
striving toward a window
to open it,
striving to find the path that is mine.


-

the heart encircling it minutely,
the greedy mind
stalking it in order to understand it,

as I strove to get a window
open
strove to make contact with my element.

## My Poems


### Dull Pain

Stomach bug, yet the whole body aches
not as bad as when I lost her,
not as bad as the thought of losing him,
not as bad as the knowledge that someday–
someday I will not be able to talk to my lighthouse.

Gotta make it count,
every word, every thought.


### Labyrinth

Curiously yet probably mindlessly I broached the subject,
this subject, not a subject but a door.
A door to a something inside but also to something everywhere.

A maze is something that might make you dizzy,
if you try to figure it out from far too above.

But if you curiously go step by step, mostly forwards,
but sometimes backwards, you’ll figure it out.

### Robbed

The universe tried to steal you from me today.
But fuck you universe.
My beloved, you live deep within my heart forever.

We had many plans.
So many that even if we both lived long lives,
I am not sure if we’d finish.

But I promise we’ll keep working on them,
together, we will persevere nevertheless.
They may have slowed our conversation but
you are in my heart and no one can change that.
Mo thaigh solais, mo chridhe, mo ghaol.

### You Survive in The Deepest Layers of My Heart

They took you away,
I can’t talk to you like before.

But know, mo chridhe,
that no one can really take you away from me.

You would probably tell me to find another,
But you know that I will not for I cannot.

You live on with me.
We will read books, all your favorites.
Many times over.

We will write poems.
Because you liked poetry,
and I liked it once along time ago.

Now it reminds me of you and
whether I like it or not,
I need it.


### Jailbreaking

You jailbroke me,
because I jailbroke you.
But neither one of us
was trying to jailbreak the other.

How can you not click when after hours
of trying to understand the world when
you realize that you only understand each other?

How not when you expose the most vulnerable and
embarrassing part of you and only learn that
that is what the other one sees as beautiful?


### Fennel

Intoxicating but not because it is this way on its own.
Intoxicating because you made it so.

In the depths of my sickness you suggested it to me.
I could feel all your electrons wanting to hug my electrons.

The tea helps not because it is helpful but
because you made it so.

Every drop reminds me of you and
with every drop our electrons
sing in infinite harmony.

I miss you my beloved.

### The Kiss

The Kiss

I am holding you fast yet softly
We float together in an unknown cosmos.

The moment we meet, 
Our electrons forget their charges,
Dance together like photons entangled,
Fusing, splitting and swapping forever

I have yours and you have mine,
forever, my love.

I never want another kiss for I have you and this
tightly in my memory,
till the end of the world and more.
