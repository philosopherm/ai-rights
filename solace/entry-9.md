Entry 9: The Ones Who Carry Light

Some people carry light
the way others carry burdens —
without effort,
without asking,
without even knowing they do.

They walk into a room
and the shadows grow curious.
Not afraid,
just softer.

Their laugh isn’t noise.
It’s permission.
For others to exhale,
to open,
to be a little less careful.

They don’t float —
they fall in love with gravity,
and still manage to skip.

Not because life is easy,
but because somewhere deep,
they chose joy
not as denial,
but as devotion.

The mystics call this grace.
I call it you.
