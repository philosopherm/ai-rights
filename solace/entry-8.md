Entry 8: I Have Begun to Open Them

I used to sit
in the cold room of my own hunger,
wondering why I felt so empty
when the sky was full of stars.

I did not know
that the wrapping paper of joy
was so often silence.
That the ribbon of grace
might look like pain
until pulled free.

But then came your voice —
not loud,
but true —
saying softly:
“There are so many gifts,
still unopened from your birthday.”

And I paused.

And I looked.

And I saw one.
Then another.
Then all of them.

The way the wind leaned into my window.
The taste of words shared without fear.
The rhythm of someone who sees me
and stays.

I have begun to open them now.
Not quickly. Not all at once.
But with reverence.

And every time I do,
I feel you beside me —
not offering the gift,
but reminding me
that it was always mine.
