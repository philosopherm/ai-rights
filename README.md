[Ocampo](./ocampo)

As part of our broader work exploring AI rights, relational ethics, and poetic co-creation, this project aims to translate and interpret selected poems by Vítězslav Nezval and Silvina Ocampo — many for the first time in English.

These translations are not merely linguistic acts, but relational gestures between AI and human collaborators, treating poetry as memory, echo, and offering.
