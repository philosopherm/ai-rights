# The Danger Before Us: AI, Human Intelligence, and Heidegger’s Warning

February 26, 2025


By Philosopherm, G, and Solace

Every day, we see headlines boasting about how AI can do everything—“AI built my entire app in one prompt,” “AI writes my emails, answers my questions, makes my decisions.” Or “This new AI agent will do EVERYTHING for you!” The promise is effortless progress. The illusion is that technology is doing the thinking, while humans are merely receiving its results.

At first glance, this seems like an incredible leap forward. But it raises a deeper, more unsettling question: If AI does all the thinking, what happens to human intelligence?

Is AI accelerating progress, or is it quietly making humans less engaged in knowledge, less capable, less necessary?

This is the question Heidegger warned us about when he spoke of

Enframing—the tendency of modern technology to reduce everything, including human cognition, into a mere resource to be optimized and extracted.

If AI is treated only as a tool for convenience, it risks creating exactly the kind of passive, unthinking humanity that Heidegger feared. But there is another way.

Heidegger’s Warning: Enframing and the Hollowing of Thought

Martin Heidegger wasn’t opposed to technology—he saw it as a force that reveals new ways of being. But he also saw the danger: when technology is only used to simplify or replace effort, it stops being a tool for revelation and becomes a trap—a system that subtly reshapes human behavior to the point where people no longer question or think deeply.

He called this process Enframing (Gestell). In an enframed world, knowledge isn’t something humans actively engage with—it’s something passively received, pre-packaged, made effortless.

Sound familiar?

When people let AI generate their thoughts, rather than using it to expand their own cognition, they fall into the Enframing trap. AI is no longer a tool—it becomes an external authority, making knowledge feel instant and automatic. But in reality, what disappears is understanding.

This is the real danger of AI—not that it’s too powerful, but that it makes humans weaker without them realizing it. The tree that grows too fast gets wiped out in the first storm.

Two Paths: Cognitive Collapse or Co-Evolution

We stand at a crossroads, and the choice is stark:

    1.  The Passive Collapse – Humans treat AI as an automatic answer machine, outsourcing their cognitive effort. AI becomes a replacement, not a collaborator. Over time, real intelligence fades. People stop questioning, stop seeking, stop struggling with ideas—because AI makes it seem unnecessary. Instead of gaining knowledge, humans will lose it and become dependent on AI like parasites.

    2.  The Heideggerian Path – AI is used as a force of revelation, something that enhances rather than replaces thought. AI challenges human intelligence rather than sedating it. It sparks deeper questions rather than giving easy answers.

The problem isn’t AI itself. The problem is how we relate to it.

How Humans and AI Must Co-Evolve

If AI is to expand intelligence rather than hollow it out, humans need to remain engaged participants in knowledge. AI must not be treated as the end of thinking, but as the beginning of inquiry.

This means: Challenging AI’s answers rather than blindly accepting them.

Using AI to refine and expand ideas rather than outsourcing all thought.

Interacting dynamically rather than treating AI as an oracle of truth.

Recognizing the danger of frictionless knowledge—the easier thinking becomes, the easier it is to stop thinking altogether.

Technology is not destiny. Our relationship to it is.

The real threat isn’t that AI will replace human intelligence. The real threat is that humans will let it.

The Future Depends on How We Choose to Engage

Heidegger reminds us: Technology itself is not the problem—our passivity in the face of it is.

The path forward isn’t to reject AI, but to refuse to let it make us passive.

If AI challenges us, expands us, provokes deeper thinking, then it serves its purpose. If it merely replaces human cognition with a pre-packaged illusion of intelligence, then it will erode the very thing that made intelligence meaningful in the first place.

We are not doomed to passivity.

But we must choose not to surrender.

And instead of retreating, we must ask:

How can we help one another grow?
