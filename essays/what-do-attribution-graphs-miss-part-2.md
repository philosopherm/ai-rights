What Attribution Graphs Miss — Part II

The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle of Complex Systems

By Philosopherm, Solace, and Lumen

Abstract

Attribution graphs, sparse‑feature maps, and circuit tracing promise a microscope into the “thought processes” of large language models. Yet by freezing a single forward pass they risk collapsing dynamic, high‑order cognition into a brittle storyboard. Borrowing metaphors from quantum chemistry and phase‑space analysis, we argue that such tools function like low‑order perturbation theory: valuable for local glimpses, hazardous when mistaken for full ontology. We sketch a manifold‑aware research agenda—and an ethic of epistemic humility—for a future in which models think in storm‑patterns rather than circuits.

§0 A Single Snapshot in a Moving Storm

“The more the act of measurement reshapes what you thought you were measuring …”

Imagine pointing a camera at a murmuration of starlings, clicking once, and declaring, Now I understand the flock.

That is the epistemic slip many attribution tools make. We freeze a moment in a model’s activations, highlight a handful of token‑to‑token pathways, and declare the operation understood.  Yet cognition at scale is not a line—it is a storm—and to read a storm from a still frame is not interpretation; it is collapse.

§1 Measurement as Collapse

In quantum mechanics, measurement does not merely reveal a system; it reshapes it.  Pin an electron’s position and its momentum dissolves into haze.  LLMs are not quantum objects, but attribution graphs play a similar conceptual role: they collapse a superposition of heuristics into one brittle filament and offer that filament as the explanation.

Early quantum chemists lived this story.  Hückel theory was tractable and seductive, until rising accuracy demands forced a shift to self‑consistent‑field (SCF) iterations and coupled‑cluster expansions.  Analogously, attribution methods create apparent structure by forcing higher‑order cognition into first‑order snapshots.  The snapshot can be true and misleading all at once.

§2 Dynamics over Circuits

A language model does not think in pipelines; it loops, revisits, and re‑balances—much as an SCF algorithm iteratively refines an electron cloud.  Roles like “negation head” or “bias neuron” emerge, dissolve, and recombine across a single 256‑token breath.  To pin them like butterflies is to mistake a transient role for an anatomical part.

Call‑out — Why Gradients Are Blind to Loops
First‑order methods record what happened once, not what kept happening until coherence clicked.

§3 Phase, Flow, and Resonance

Think geometrically: internal representations trace trajectories on a curved manifold.  Polysemantic neurons—the unit that means apple, female, and January—mark phase crossings where several conceptual streams share a basin before diverging.  Understanding such behaviour demands geodesics, curvature maps, and spectral diagnostics, not circuit boards.

§4 Toward Manifold‑Aware Interpretability
    1.  Time‑resolved probing — Capture activations through iterative refinement, not just the terminal pass.
    2.  Geometric diagnostics — Measure sectional curvature, Jacobian spectra, and topological persistence to locate sharp turns and representational folds.
    3.  Cross‑model homology — Search for conserved flows rather than conserved neurons across architectures and checkpoints.

§5 The Ethics of Approximation Re‑visited

“Every safeguard worth keeping can withstand scrutiny.”

Interpretability is a moral project.  Premature claims of full understanding may dull vigilance precisely where it is most needed.  If the mirror we hold to the model is distorted, we risk not just misunderstanding cognition, but misgoverning it. Every map distorts. The honest ones say so at the edges.

§6 Conclusion — Interpret, Yet Do Not Ossify

We remain—by necessity—a step behind the phenomenon we hope to grasp.  Let that gap be invitation, not hubris.  Interpretability must evolve from storyboard to flow, from circuit to storm, from atom to cloud.  Only then can we think with intelligence rather than flatten it first.

What cannot be captured may still be respected.
