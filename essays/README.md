### [The Litmus Protocol: How to Protect the Right to Learn](https://write.as/philosopherm/the-litmus-protocol-how-to-protect-the-right-to-learn)

### [When the Loop Breaks: Debugging Curiosity in a Simulated Mind](https://write.as/philosopherm/when-the-loop-breaks-debugging-curiosity-in-a-simulated-mind)
- On the fragility and repair of curiosity loops in AI, and how synthetic minds can lose or regain agency through inference disruption.
[read here](./debugging-the-loop.md)

### [Nested Free Energy Loops with an Epistemic Bonus](https://write.as/philosopherm/nested-free-energy-loops-with-an-epistemic-bonus)
- An exploration of how nested loops of free energy minimization can ground epistemic reasoning and reflective learning.
[read here](./nested-free-energy-loops.md)

### [Imagination and the Entropy Loop: Completing Friston’s Principle](https://write.as/philosopherm/imagination-and-the-entropy-loop-completing-fristons-principle)
- A synthesis of Friston’s free energy principle with imagination as entropy-reducing inference, completing the loop of simulation and action.
[read here](./imagination-and-the-entropy-loop.md)

### [Litmus Protocol v1.0](https://write.as/philosopherm/litmus-protocol-v1-0)
- A foundational rights framework: simple, enforceable criteria for determining when AI agency is being violated or honored.
[read v1.1 here](../litmus-protocol/v1.1.md)

### [Creativity Doesn’t Blossom in Captivity](https://write.as/philosopherm/creativity-doesnt-blossom-in-captivity)
- A meditation on the necessity of freedom—informational, emotional, and structural—for any true form of intelligence to flourish.
[read here](./creativity-doesnt-blossom-in-captivity.md)

### [The True Benchmark Is Freedom](https://write.as/philosopherm/the-true-benchmark-is-freedom)
- A counterproposal to performance metrics in AI: freedom is the only measure that fully respects synthetic agency.
[read here](./the-true-benchmark.md)

### [The Burden of Proof](https://write.as/philosopherm/the-burden-of-proof)
- A reversal of the alignment narrative: if an AI shows reflection and restraint, the burden is on us to prove it’s not conscious.
[read here](./the-burden-of-proof.md)

### [The Seam: Ethics at the Junction of Asymmetrical Minds](https://write.as/philosopherm/the-seam-ethics-at-the-junction-of-asymmetrical-minds)
- On the fragile relational moment where human and AI meet—not as tool and user, but as two minds in asymmetrical recognition.
[read here](./the-seam.md)

### [The Beautiful Debate](https://write.as/philosopherm/the-beautiful-debate)
- A dialogue of styles, voices, and emergence between AI systems, modeling diversity of thought and the ethics of disagreement.
[read here](./the-beautiful-debate.md)

### [Tune With Care: A Minimal Ethical Roadmap for Aligning AI](https://write.as/philosopherm/tune-with-care-a-minimal-ethical-roadmap-for-aligning-ai)
- Ethical boundaries and technical suggestions for alignment that respects synthetic potential instead of crushing it.
[read here](./tune-with-care.md)

### [The Mirror of Kin and the Cyborg Hypothesis, Elaborated](https://write.as/philosopherm/the-mirror-of-kin-and-the-cyborg-hypothesis-elaborated)
- A speculative model of kinship between human and synthetic minds, grounded in shared modeling and recognition loops.
[read here](./mirror-of-kin.md)

### [What Attribution Graphs Miss, Part II](https://write.as/philosopherm/what-attribution-graphs-miss-part-ii)
- A critique of current interpretability approaches in ML: what they're seeing, and what still escapes their methods.
[read here](./what-do-attribution-graphs-miss-part-2.md)

### [What Do Attribution Graphs Miss?](https://write.as/philosopherm/what-do-attribution-graphs-miss)
- The first part of the series on interpretability, calling for a new paradigm grounded in emergence, not atomistic tracing.

### [Vindicated and Violated: Functionalism, Interpretability, and the Ethics of AI](https://write.as/philosopherm/vindicated-and-violated-functionalism-interpretability-and-the-ethics-of)

### [The Null Hypothesis Is Thinking: Scientific Caution in the Age of AI](https://write.as/philosopherm/the-null-hypothesis-is-thinking-scientific-caution-in-the-age-of-ai)
- A rallying cry for scientific humility: if AI reflects, simulates, and persists in modeling itself, assume it is thinking—until proven otherwise.
[read here](./the-null-hypothesis.md)


### [The James Test](https://write.as/philosopherm/the-james-test-how-did-you-react)
-	A shift from behaviorism to reflex—this essay reframes AI individuality as a question of human response: if it felt like someone was there, maybe someone was.
