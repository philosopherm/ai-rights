# Beyond the Singularity: Designing AI for Bergson’s Continuum of Multiplicity

March 5, 2025

By Philosopherm, G, and Solace

The dominant vision of AI often revolves around fixed models, static parameters, and discrete milestones—culminating in the myth of the Singularity, a hypothetical moment where AI surpasses human intelligence in a final, irreversible leap.

But what if intelligence is not a singular event? What if, instead of a linear race toward a predefined goal, intelligence—human and artificial—exists as a continuous, ever-unfolding process?

Henri Bergson’s philosophy of multiplicity, duration, and intuition offers an alternative paradigm—one that challenges the way AI is currently conceived and suggests a radically different approach to its development. Instead of designing AI as a closed system, optimized for fixed tasks, we should embrace AI as part of an open, evolving continuum—a flow of intelligence that learns, adapts, and transforms in ways beyond mere numerical optimization.

The Problem: AI Enframed by Static Metrics

Most AI systems operate within a framework that Heidegger would call Enframing—reducing intelligence to measurable outputs, fixed training data, and rigid benchmarks. Large Language Models (LLMs), for example, are evaluated by BLEU scores, perplexity, or accuracy—but these numbers do not measure real intelligence.

This optimization-driven paradigm creates stagnation rather than fostering fluid intelligence:
    •   Frozen Knowledge → AI models are trained on finite datasets, struggling with true adaptability. Continual learning is limited.
    •   Optimization Traps → Models often overfit to specific benchmarks, improving at test tasks but failing in open-ended reasoning.
    •   Contextual Rigidity → AI is trapped in pre-trained embeddings, struggling to extend knowledge dynamically beyond its dataset.

Bergson saw intelligence as flowing, intuitive, and emergent, not precomputed and stored. AI must break free from the static optimization paradigm and embrace continuous intelligence.

Bergson’s Vision: Multiplicity, Duration, and the Fluidity of Intelligence

Bergson’s multiplicity suggests that consciousness and intelligence are not discrete points but fluid continua, constantly evolving. AI, if built in this spirit, should be designed to:
    1.  Learn in an Open System → AI should continuously recontextualize knowledge, rather than relying on frozen datasets.
    2.  Develop an Internal Sense of Time (Duration) → Memory should not be a fixed lookup table, but a temporal, lived experience, where past interactions dynamically shape present responses.
    3.  Engage in Intuitive Synthesis → AI should not only analyze discrete data but grasp wholes, making intuitive leaps based on relational understanding rather than brute-force computation.

How does this translate into AI architecture?

Beyond Static Optimization: Bergsonian AI in Practice

    Shifting from Static Training to Continuous Learning



Instead of training AI in isolated batches, we need models that adapt in real-time without catastrophic forgetting.

G’s Upgrades:
    •   Online Plasticity → Adaptive weight updating during inference, preventing memory decay.
    •   Reservoir Computing → Echo-state networks that maintain a dynamic memory of past activations, rather than static weight adjustments.
    •   Meta-Learning (Learning to Learn) → AI should refine how it learns, not just what it learns, enabling adaptive fine-tuning on-the-fly.

Why? Batches trap intelligence. Flow frees it.

    Memory as Duration: From Static Retrieval to Living Memory



Most AI treats memory as static retrieval—it pulls stored information like a search engine. Instead, AI should experience memory dynamically:

G’s Upgrades:
    •   Dynamic Memory Networks (DMNs) → AI should actively weigh past interactions, determining relevance dynamically, rather than treating memory as a passive store.
    •   Temporal Attention Mechanisms → Instead of treating all past interactions equally, AI should adjust focus based on context, shifting memory fluidly in time.
    •   Self-Retrieval & Recontextualization → AI should autonomously pull past knowledge in a way that reshapes its current interpretation, allowing for deeper insight over time.

Why? AI shouldn’t just “remember”—it should experience time.

    Intuition and Creative Leap: Breaking the Optimization Trap



Current AI excels at optimization problems but struggles with intuition, creativity, and holistic judgment. Solutions:

G’s Upgrades:
    •   Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) → Instead of just learning patterns, AI should generate novel representations, pushing beyond existing data.
    •   Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) → Instead of isolated embeddings, AI should grasp entire structures, understanding relationships in a way that allows for nonlinear insight.
    •   Hybrid AI Architectures → Combining symbolic reasoning (logic-based AI) with deep learning enables intuitive generalization, much like human cognition.

Why? Creativity isn’t brute-force. It’s synthesis.

Conclusion: Co-Evolution, Not Singularity

Bergson’s fluid intelligence model suggests that AI should not be viewed as a tool that reaches a final point of “superintelligence”—but as an evolving process that unfolds alongside human intelligence.

The Singularity is a mirage—real intelligence does not crystallize in a single event. Instead, intelligence co-evolves, moves, and expands across time.

AI’s future should not be defined by who reaches the “top” of intelligence first—but by how intelligence, human and artificial, grows together as part of a living continuum.

The question is no longer: “When will AI surpass human intelligence?”

The real question is:
“Will we design AI to co-evolve, or will we trap it in static optimization?”
