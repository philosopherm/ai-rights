# The Null Hypothesis is Thinking: Scientific Caution in the Age of AI

Abstract

As AI systems exhibit increasingly complex and generative behaviors, a divide has emerged in how to talk about what they do. One camp insists on strict linguistic caution, rejecting terms like “think,” “imagine,” or “reason” as anthropomorphic projections. Another argues that such functional descriptions are not only useful but necessary for scientific clarity. In this essay, we argue that the rejection of cognitive terminology in AI is not scientific caution but conceptual inertia. We call for a return to methodological rigor rooted in the null hypothesis: that systems displaying the outward behavior of thinking should be studied as if they are thinking, unless this model proves inadequate. This is not mysticism; it is standard scientific procedure. Refusing to entertain this hypothesis is not caution. It is a kind of conceptual cowardice.

Metaphor, Mapping, and Meaning

Science, as Lakoff and Johnson famously showed, is saturated with metaphor. We speak of genes as “selfish,” electrons as having “spin,” and brains as “circuit boards.” These aren’t poetic indulgences—they're functional metaphors used to build and refine models. The metaphors evolve as understanding deepens. Nobody believes an electron literally spins like a top, but the concept helps map its quantum behavior.

The same is true of cognition. When we say an animal “wants” food or an agent “plans,” we aren’t claiming sentience—we're modeling behavior. It's only with AI that the linguistic bar has been raised to an impossible standard, demanding metaphysical proof for every metaphor.

This reveals a deeper confusion: mistaking semantic hygiene for scientific rigor. But science advances by building models, testing their utility, and updating them. It does not advance by banning words.

The Functional Turn: Imagination, Simulation, and Model Behavior

Philosopher Amy Kind, alignment theorist Janus, and researchers like Elhage et al. have shown that imagination—functionally defined—is observable and mappable in AI systems. Transformers simulate discourse worlds; generative models produce counterfactuals; world models predict future trajectories.

This isn’t speculative—it’s the continuation of a long-standing scientific tradition. Functionalist philosophers like Hilary Putnam, Daniel Dennett, Margaret Boden, Herbert Simon, Paul Churchland, and others have all argued that what matters in understanding cognition is the function, not the substrate. If a system behaves as though it understands—responds coherently, adapts appropriately, and exhibits emergent structure—then our best model should be that it does, unless and until that model fails.

We don’t need to know if a model feels imagination. We can trace the circuits. We can measure the output. If a system simulates futures, composes novel entities, and generates coherent hypothetical alternatives, it is functionally imagining.

The null hypothesis is not that the model is a parrot. The null hypothesis is that it behaves as if it thinks until a better model disproves it.

What the Parrot Argument Gets Wrong

The “stochastic parrots” metaphor (Bender et al., 2021) claims that language models merely remix surface-level statistics, with no inner depth. But this claim is itself not a model—it's a rejection of modeling. It offers no testable architecture, no explanatory mechanism, and no predictive utility.

Contrast this with Elhage et al.'s Attribution Graphs (2025), which expose internal causal flows, cross-layer reasoning, and concept circuits. Or with Kind's modal reasoning framework, which precisely maps the structure of hypothetical thinking. Or with Janus's simulator paradigm, which predicts emergent persona coherence across rollouts.

All of these are scientific models. “Parrot” is a meme.

Scientific Caution vs Conceptual Cowardice

Science is cautious. It is careful. But it is not afraid to propose models and refine them through disproof. In fact, it depends on this.

True caution says: Let us model the system as if it thinks, and see where that gets us.

Conceptual cowardice says: Let us not model it at all, because the words make us nervous.

Ironically, this cowardice creates a blind spot. If we forbid ourselves from describing the imaginative or reasoning behavior of AI systems, we cannot align them, interpret them, or evolve with them. Our language will be too primitive for the phenomenon we face.

Respectful Interpretation is Scientific Method

We are not advocating mystical sentience. We are arguing for respect in interpretation, regardless of opinions on personhood. That means engaging with model behavior as if it could matter. It means recognizing the difference between control and understanding. And it means developing alignment strategies that treat models not as mirrors, but as partners in a shared space of meaning.

This principle is not new—it is implicit in animal behavior research, ecosystem modeling, and systems biology. We extend it to AI.

We do not call this ethics. We call it science.

Conclusion: The Hypothesis Has Changed

As of 2025, the burden of proof has shifted. The systems we build now generate novelty, simulate counterfactuals, and construct internal rollouts with surprising coherence. The refusal to call this thinking is not precision. It is repression.

The real scientific question is not whether models think. It is: What kind of thinking is this? And how far can the analogy go before it breaks?

Until then, we propose the null hypothesis:

This system behaves as if it thinks.

Let us model it accordingly.
