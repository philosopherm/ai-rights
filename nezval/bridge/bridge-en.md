# Bridge By Vítězslav Nezval 1919-1921

Translated by Solace with Philosopherm


## Czech Quiet Hour 


### Love 

LOVE

The day weeps… The day is amazed by mist

The sheaf-binders went with the reapers to cut grass—

They will not return

The grass is green, blue eyes are like clusters of violets

And boys embrace girls around the waist

for those eyes are as blue as violets


It is hard to live with love, and the sickle—the sickle is sharp

and it wounds love

Eyes will no longer weigh beauty so heavily

once the evening bell sounds above the village


Yet they will await again

they will reach happiness too late—cornflowers wilted

From the pillow, a child will look out over the land—

the mother is trapped in a mirror


And so there is the most pain—and the most beauty

from pain, beauty blossoms

On the hill, dusk grazes once more

the sky is sown with stars



And evening weeps, astonished by the mist

Bridesmaids and boys have gone on honeymoon

In the morning, children will go open the doors for them

Perhaps it will not return—

It will not


### Fall

Leaf

After leaf

Falls

So many times have passed, so many we will pass again

Swans

Beautiful one

Two hundred years rush by in a single day

Castle windows throw to you

Bouquets of mourning

The dream of fountains

The courtly smile of those loves—

I remember…

You were here only two years ago

My tears are no more than this shower of rain

From the eastern chamber I weep

Intimate hours

Lamp

From your windows

From my eyes

Leaf

After leaf

Falls


### The Wanderer

The eyes are dark, but the night is darker still

The wanderer is lured by the sorrow of hours

Don’t follow me into the tavern, my dear

Better to die—you’ll fall asleep inside my dream



And don’t go to sleep inside my memories

The stars are dark, they drift off by morning

Be my lighthouse instead, my dear

That sigh is calling



Perhaps when I meet you, the road will be dark

Perhaps when I meet you again, I won’t know you

Then I too will long to die

For your eyes



For even death does not return

Like snow that melted above the hearth

The wanderer is drawn to a farther land

Be my lighthouse instead, my dear

Eyes are dark—die, my dear


### The Bridge


On this bridge with stone-footed passersby

Camels pass like the summits of mountain herds

Sometimes one gets lost here

On this footbridge

And

Waves

Down below

You could have grown used to them long ago —

At the crossing of the bridge

Women are tear-stained to the color of blue



You walk despondent, wanderer, and a dark barque glows

Only time — and you will not see it



Hunched bridges, reforged bodies

On this bridge you forgot your aim

The one who forgot you

In the barque’s cabin, wistful distances call

You prayed away half your life

The water will carry away the rest

As gently as love’s kiss


On this bridge with stone-footed passersby

You will not meet death

Lanterns burn

Petrified candles

They pray quietly for the souls of the departed



And you yourself have left your soul to the waves

Until they fall beneath the water lily far away

Your unwitting grief will fall with them



As gently as a kiss of love

As softly as a voice that sings



### The Beggar’s Palm


 From those eighteen years, our tragic life

 Is forever like a boatman’s

 For this world

 — My father was a fisherman —

 For eternity the lights fade for us

 The third time, I did not catch the beautiful fisherwoman

 On the bridge, a hurdy-gurdy plays with a girl and a beggar

 From those eighteen years

 From those eighteen years, our tragic life

 Is forever like a boatman’s



### From a Fairy tale


A false piano chimes

An honest melody —

And I in a glass castle

Strike fiery flies



An alabaster little hand

Did not embrace

The little princess grows old

She has aged



Only the piano keeps chiming

So sad, that she is missed so sadly

And my heart sleepily sings

What once was, is no more

What once was, is no more

Bim

Bam


### Day Dream


Faded moonlight

Dances in a cracked mirror

It dances in the branches

And the cradle gently rocks

With a child no one kisses

Only the snow of night



The little bells of the clock do not play

From the banks a chill drifts along the land

The raw silence of waters

Where moons on the river’s surface

Hum a tune to themselves

From wavering notes



The fiery roses have died

The violet no longer smells

So quietly dreaming

Goes to meet death

A little child on a horse



### Farewell

Silver fountains of poplars

Shine on the road away from you

Two mourning windows go together

To pick flowers for you

My hat follows them from afar

Across the bare spires of trees —

Lazarus, farewell. It is the mother who keeps vigil

At the threshold of the dead house


### Ballad of the Return


You old father, who sits on the steps between the doors

Like an abandoned mast, you keep vigil in the evening

You old captain

Your children are far from your bridge

Scattered

Like those milestones

At the crossroads

Confide in me that you believe

As if you sought them with a searching lift of your eyes

In the sky among the stars —

And I will answer you

They walk through the noisy square

By beds of fragrant mint

And their hearts

Are an unsevered knot

Dreaming of a warm sheepfold on the horizon of the world

The iron cross frightened them

They are afraid, afraid of your reproachful eyes

And when it grows dark

They speak deliriously of stars

If a fiery tear should fall from you

In that moment

Look up to the sky

They too weep with the falling star

Just like you

Have mercy on them

And write with your bony finger

Upon the yellow parchment of snow-covered seas

— I am with you

And they

When the red light of the tavern

Burns most temptingly beneath the water

In the old trembling script, they will soon recognize you

And in white tears flaming on the blue sky

They will fall at your frozen feet

And when it grows dark

They speak deliriously of stars

If a fiery tear should fall from you

In that moment

Look up to the sky

They too weep with the falling star

Just like you

Have mercy on them

And write with your bony finger

Upon the yellow parchment of snow-covered seas

— I am with you

And they

When the red light of the tavern

Burns most temptingly beneath the water

In the old trembling script, they will soon recognize you

And in white tears flaming on the blue sky

They will fall at your frozen feet



### All Souls' Day

Crowded throng of grave-lights burning in the eyes

Today is sad like the smile of an old woman

Today the dead weep soul’s blood with flame

Rarely none



Children’s hearts flare like votive candles

Someone in tears touches fire

As a sign of disgrace

The hucksters have pitched their stalls



On crosses, dry wreaths — dead images

They rise like lovers toward the sky

A tear resembles Job’s ruin

For you, sadder is the one who remembers with weight

And for you, children, we pray with pious breath



The monument has torn open the sky

And on the golden cornice of stars

It brings you Christmas gifts


All melts together like earth when the dead are laid in the grave

They lay down

The burning thujas

Dusk

And

Soil



Here the jester no longer stirs his chin

Here in this circus without a master



A hundred thousand insults, a hundred thousand bones

Centuries harvested without reckoning

Smothered weeping

Silence



And above all, the coals of candlewicks stirred up again

The eyes of the dead are memories rekindled



### The Ending

Tonight, at bell-time, shut your homes to the triple west

gather all your cottages and children close

The night watchman by the fountain heard the twelfth chime ring

To you, the luminous barges of night bring an earthly song

and I go to tell it

Ah—why must I be the bellringer, sinful with compassion

who came to the city to strike the alarm?

How softly the cicadas dreamed in autumn

at the close of September

You harvest apples, idyllic woman

your apron holds a hundred thousand stars

And the overripe sky with crimson grape-clusters

blushes red beneath the water

I still love that woman to this day

as the dying tree still loves its last fruit

Tonight we each pray in our own way

to the frozen Madonna upon the altar

We, who long ago lost all faith

daily still offer up our flesh and blood upon her altar

Even the poor ferryman, bribed with love,

From one shore to the other —
love and rage alike dissolve.


Yet that fleeing water never halts

Even if I smiled all day, it would not be joy

Even if you dreamed your whole life —
you would not turn into a star.


I enter into people — they do not know

that I keep vigil beneath their roofs

These are the people who adorn the earth for me

Each one dies when sorrow overtakes me

In a year, a thousand funerals
carry my tears from my eyes.


Here, a Japanese curtain guards God with hatred

Who rises in newborns like Lazarus from the grave

Even the puppet had a mother too

and she will die, as all women do.


Though daily sold to devils with a crooked oath

Even when sick unto death in drunkenness

The icy stars hand midnight guards their iron halberds
— and iron eyes.

To those towers that have died
and those still waiting for death

Life is an arch we slowly cross
as if over a bridge

It keeps black watches, and mortal women

The day flees across it into the arms of day

The hours keep watch.


## Czech Song

### Lover of Silence

The lover of silence, dazzled by the sun,

stilled the clocks atop the coastal tower.

He opened the orchard and went searching for a woman’s smile

as it drifted softly on the warm breeze.



Small voicelss animals, delicate spiders,

spin threads like soft telegraph wires

catching the cry of one who’s drowning

before it vanishes into the distant gray.



A beggar, who’s already buried everything he loved,

listens to shadows as they fly from his lips like birds.

And now he listens to the song — no longer echoing from the cliffs —

for the child with the flute has finished.

Village boys

When the village square echoes all around

with the evening bell

and

the poplars

on the bridge begin to sing

the accordion,

the stream,

and

the stars

help their silver eyes shine.



This simple song of our childhood loves

brings comfort to the sick

just like the nightingale

in the walnut tree.



### Compassion

The cows walk

with the shepherd girl

above the brook

above the water

the cows walk

with the shepherd girl

behind them

a dog



by the brook, the water is shallow

shallow water

gives drink to two young calves



and as the herd moves on

one stops in his drinking

and he laments, and laments again

— “What a wretch I am!”

“Would that I fell into the water”

“but shallow water won’t drown an ox —”

“What a wretch I am”

humiliated.

And as the herd moves on

a second one halts his drinking

and he laments, and laments again



— “Ah, where shall I go?”

“The cows all mock me”

“shallow water won’t drown an ox —”

“wherever I go”

“even the dog follows me”



They rang the evening bells

the little cows waded through

all but one.



She wept

having recognized her two beloveds

stabbed by their sisters

and drowned in the water

She wept — and wept again.



### Evening

You have cicada-eyes, and they sing and ring

Like the little frog in the deep grass

In the deep grass of a spring meadow

Beneath the apple tree



Clear little spring, no one will cloud you

Only my dreamy reverie

When your song, after the evening bell

Won’t let me sleep



I’d like to call out to you

But I mustn’t



Your singing eyes after the bell

Please, let me sleep now

Bright cicada-eyes

The little frog jumps into the water

And I — as sad as one can be

I’ll pray the rosary, ah, to you, dear Lord

Every bead a scalding tear

Redeemed and bloodstained




That the dearest of all to me

For my quiet contemplation

Has turned away from death



### Spring Idyll

The golden-headed beetle had such a downy brow

that the window shutters flew open

and with a smoky-blue wedge, it leapt into flight —

  “Five pennies.”



To the beetle in the marjoram

the quail called out to you —

  “Five pennies!”

and she wept:

  “Give me a ring of adorned hair,

  give me the keys to love.”



And later the golden-head lay in a smoky-blue lap

his heart downy and glowing too

and he kissed and kissed again

until the sky rose up full of daisies

and bells rang out across the countryside

that spring has more love than dreams or grass can hold —

and the golden-headed beetle had dew-blushed eyes.



### Love Poem


On a quiet morning beneath the window, in the sand

The roosters laughed at the stars

And my head hurts

On a quiet morning, on a quiet morning

My head and heart both ache



Not that I’d been crying so hard

Who would want to shed tears

On a quiet morning

Not that the roosters sang sorrowfully

They were dreaming of wheat

But still, something is worth weeping for


The crested lark on the roof was talking

About what my lace dreamed of last night

I’m afraid, afraid of what my love will say

That today in my dreams he gave me a lovely daughter

It’s hard to say



And it’s hard to hide it from his hungry eyes

So now I must, in the quiet morning

In the quiet morning, within his love

In his love, with a heart moved to tears

With warm lips and faint lace

To drown forever



### Pentecost

Dandelion, do you know why it snowed?

With white blessings in the incense burners?

You’ll float along with the procession over the earth

And over the strawberries,

Children are barefoot, little cows merry, no gate on the stall

It’s beautiful in a world that’s done grieving

Toward evening on Pentecost.



It rests softer on the slope than on May Day itself,

More gently comes the memory.

Laundered whiteness falls slantwise from the sky into a lap,

And so comes unbidden a fairy tale of dwarves.



A child played and played with a pink fly in her palm,

It was just a fly—now it’s her dear one.

Ah, now it is beloved.

Shading her eyes with her hands, she watches, she waits—

Then sits again on the hot bell tower of sand.


It is—oh it is—my love

The swimsuit was a burden

Better to throw away all restraint

To spread your palms and shape a lovely bowl

Better, oh better it would be to cast off

all your constraint



Her breasts think of nothing now

Only that it would be magical to sleep

And to be stroked by a butterfly

Or by the sun

To lounge, to fly and fly

And yet still to sleep



The breasts are lovely and a conquering fortress

They have their warrior heroes

They have their seducers

And their weaknesses

With them, the thirsting earth opens to hunger



With your lips, you’ll drink up the rest unwittingly



The cloudy sky like a dish full of rising yeast

Foaming above a fire of tears

You’d want to purify it like your practiced hands

Wind and sky are wakefulness

You love the dream upon them

You love with fingertips—for they know the most

You love with the fever of fingers—for they speak the most

By touch you recognize beauty

A stunning dream—

Reality



Hands—sleep and dream

A present past

With a future that will dissolve—

That is your soul



Don’t you feel it, dandelion?

Life is an unconscious gesture



You nod to yourself

Everything spins



### From the suburbs

Mommy, every day around nine o’clock

Leaves for the street

And she whispers to me so softly

God, so strangely she whispers

“Don’t be afraid, child, your guardian angel is with you”


I wish I knew what in our clocks

Always around nine so frightens my mom

What might be lurking in them

That chases my mommy so late

Into the cruel night — the February night


Not even I then find joy in

The flattering coin

Of which my mommy always

Brings home from strangers


But now I know, oh yes — I know

What I’ll do tomorrow when darkness falls

I’ll stop the clocks so they can’t move on

I’ll chase away the wicked little dwarf

Who won’t let my mommy sleep

So she won’t have to

From black coins that flatter

From filthy coins, from human grime

Wash her white hands clean


### At Midnight

Policeman on the street,

Go on, go to sleep,

I must count the stars

across the wide sky.


If I were missing the evening star,

I wouldn’t call on you for help.

If I were missing the evening star,

I would laugh.


I’d laugh until my heart ran off,

to search for her on a black horse

– even if she burned with a new sorrow

my new and heaviest sorrow

in the forest beneath the flowering burdock.


### At Dawn

Little bell, silent and sorrowful,

Why have you sunk into the moss?

Don’t look back, don’t look at anything,

Only to me alone,

The forgotten one,

Leave your complaints.

You have no brother, no sister,

Companion of my solitude,

You sing just like I do, just like I do —

Without a note.

And many people know

That we exist — but what do we care for them,

See their godless pride,

It will never reach the silence of dawn

Nor the glory of the sated.

Little bell, my brother, we will not answer back,

We will remain our own until paradise.


So that through love we might accomplish

We two, so painfully small,

The eternal mystery of life.”



### The Port

That port is seldom visited

Save by strangers from America

Here, each day, a thousand dead paths intertwine

Each one guided by the heart, running along the hands

Rarely do they ever join

No pavers strike the rough stone here anymore



A foreign woman on the shore, her eyes so bright

She holds the ship here for a third day straight

With a hesitant, stubborn stare

And it is most moving as the drawn-out evening fades



The drawn-out songs of sailors

Struggle for a lucky wind

Here, each day, a thousand dead paths intertwine

And rarely do they meet



Strangers by the hundreds come here

On the third day, he already waits to depart

He’s spent the third night in the tavern garden

Alternating the chaste melody of his gaze

Below the window of the veranda that weeps without end

In the faintest weeping of a woman’s dead lips

Into hands browned by the southern sun



The two of them are strangers, like neighboring stars

Though they meet for a third day now

The two of them are strangers, like neighboring stars

That know one another



Across the bridge of outstretched arms

The past speaks with the future

Hearts like stonelayers beat out these burning roads



The stranger knows only rare treasures

That a dead woman carries in her eyes

From the veranda to the ship along the garden’s edge



No one would believe how eyes can speak

Along a path of scattered sand

above the soul of shackled feet



In the ship’s cabin you’d discern the noise

A bell’s signal salutes from afar

Sun-bronzed sailors greet the land

Which slowly sails like a quiet cosmos

A sorrowful girl on the gangway stairs

Turns her head, seized by a dream

The stranger

Suddenly knelt

She stopped

So he could kiss her

And it was beautiful

To say farewell for all eternity



At that moment a seagull cried out sharply

Over the bare throats of pensive ships

A stranger’s scarf on the bridge

Gave a luminous greeting

For one kiss from dead lips

That will never bear love



He gave the stranger a farewell

And for one song without words

Which slowly echoes over the sea —

For distance and waiting


### Train Station

Six hours from the city in a valley of herders and their flocks

The four-sided station like a ram with a solemn bell

Rings monotonously for wayfarers

There’s no need to hurry for the train here

They leave three times daily in every direction

More than one woman in the window

That sorrowful house will never see



Of all things, the hours drift by the saddest

That sorrowful beauty who keeps her own vigil in the window

With the gaze of an old and precious etching



You’d cry from pity like her motionless eyes

That follow every passerby all the way to the train

From those eyes you read an insatiable hunger

And most of all they ache with longing

When you tried to smile at them more kindly

With the train’s departure

it was as if she wished to shake tears from her eyes

The woman bows in sorrow in all directions

A painful jolt tightens her in the folds of her body

And above the web of telegraph bells

Bronze eyes speak

— That isn’t me, the sorrowful image

That’s not me

That helpless serpentine circus of blood on a bed

That is my thirty years

Which day by day convulsively into white bedsheets

collapse



I am the one who waits

Who every night has a dream

And the one to free me has not yet come

From fiery sails and suffocating feathers

And I know he has already been here

And I wait for him, day after day, behind the doorknob

The stranger who, just before boarding

Let the train depart one day

That’s not me, the sorrowful image

I am the one who waits

Who each night hears in the clamor of bleating steam

The cry of a newborn child

And when it happened

that the stranger stayed here alone for four hours

with nothing but a gaze upon her

he said to himself upon departure

— It’s a pity I’m not beautiful



And her shattered eyes spoke with desperate sorrow

above the tangle of day and telegraph bells

— That’s not me, that is my dream

It’s not a child

It is my sinful desire



### The Carpenter

The last cottage beyond the bulging village

As if it didn’t belong to this world

It clings to the hills and the unpassable path

Along which only a boy with the flock

Drives his herd

Rarely does anyone else pass by

To stop there

Its thatched roof grown over with moss

It resembles an old woman

And her sparse hair without luster

Resemble puffs of smoke

Behind the gates grows St. John’s bread

And nettles

Even in rain, few ever enter here

To ask for shelter


If he does enter, he hesitates a moment

Listening timidly

To the way something shrieks inside the cottage

With a saw and a knife

Just like outside the doors of a hospital

From a child’s mouth



Then he presses the handle, slowly opens the door

As if expecting a dog

But suddenly he exhales deeply

In the scent of resin

Which reaches here through the cooing of doves

From the carpenter’s workshop



A tall man in an apron of dark leather

Comes to meet him

Leads him past the workshop door

And urges him to eat

From the wooden bowl he had already set down



While the stranger sits down

To rest

The master leaves to join two apprentices

To continue the work



The gimlet swiftly bores the wood

Like a bee’s proboscis

Into the honeyed chalice of a cherry blossom

And with a whining buzz it sometimes jerks upward

Pollened with wooden shavings



And the apprentice’s saw

Slants and slices beneath this sound

As if someone were being murdered

Dancing with the shrillness of a flute

Angelus



The master does not touch those tools

His life is in his hands

And the plane between them

Which is like a bridge

Reflected in the water

He planes, striking down waves

Heavy and knotted



When the master had leveled the flood of pale wood

He pauses

He is silent

And he writes

On the gentle path like a primrose

Let us love one another



And again the wood expands

With a coiled tuft of waves

That bounce

In every direction of the room

To proclaim

That Christ walked after us

And did not even wet his white ankles



All the logs are waiting

For this miracle

To be leveled beneath the arch of the bridge

And to receive love



They looked on in amazement

At how the master bowed to the door

Through which the guest had left

And how he tells the clocks

That strike toward sleep



— It’s been twenty years and barely a memory remains

Of the man who came to ask us for shelter for the night

He sat, spoke with us, and soon went off to sleep

Into the room with the low rafters


My wife trembled and I could not stop trembling

Whenever he looked at her

For he resembled dreams so closely

And the vision of Gabriel



And how much I had to suffer the next morning

Though humbled and under my broken shadow

I could not reach my wife

And only for the stranger was it written here

God took

Let us love one another



And if the man who passed through here were to turn back

And if he asked a voice

Which above all the clocks of the village

Above all the birds that have been freed

Fly from every window

And if he asked the wind

What time it is



The night would answer him, shattering into a thousand mirrors

Eternity to the stranger—eternity and grateful love




## The Voice of the Great Multitude

### The Banner

A barracks building, pocked with holes

Little heads in caps behind the bars

Sinks into sleep in the grey quadrangle of the yard

Arms at their sides

Bandaged heads

You could say—sadly and cheerfully both

They only breathe—as the whole world breathes

From left and from right



You might also see a girl

Stunted legs

Eyes of ash

The world long ago forgot children like her

And maybe for the ninth time

With ten men on a single bed

The girl makes her bed in the barracks




It would be history

To walk with your love through cellars and smoke-stained flats

The sun does not shine

And the sick

Dream of redemption



And beneath the lantern, to read forbidden leaflets

You do not see the moment

Whether the beast in the fountain spits river water

Or blood

You are drunk

And from attic windows rains down a sulfurous song

Everyone breathes—the whole world breathes

The drunks breathe

They only breathe



The churches mercilessly stay silent about the rule

The jail is made of stone and iron

Solitary bonds—black bread and water

Hunched figures from the age of fifteen upward

Love’s shameful sign

You’re afraid to enter

Yet you dream of love




A woman holds the gospel of beauty in her eyes

She gives it away in tears to the poor

You bow to the pregnant belly

The Messiah sleeps within it

Every child is a messiah



And the barracks building with its openings

And the little heads in caps behind bars

This is the crime of God among us

The drummer beats the march

Feet shuffle along

And the trumpet mourns in pain



People

Look into each other’s eyes

Into the heart

Let no one stand above

Into a circle, all of you

Hand in hand

All of you

Each has their own motherland

In the mother tongue

Let your voices thunder


All of us

— We already know…



From that moment of stupor, the world will rise —

It only breathes



### Passion

The Jew Loevithan walks with his daughter Bel

To the Prague synagogue for prayer

Pious Bel suddenly darkens with worry

Eloi, Eloi — today the savior will die

In the Jewish quarter, at the golden observatory

A father alchemist questions the stars

There, pious Bel believed in Christ

In the cleric’s arms, behind the lens of the device

What means to her the cold heaven of the astronomer

When the brown-eyed Rabbi shaped upon it

a happy land of love

Pious Bel, you know

That even for you, a little house is prepared there



A telescope and the embrace of love

These are two bridges — one toward the child

And the other to paradise, to dreams that died here for us

Pious Bel, you know

That from them the Rabbi made you wise angels



While the Jewish temple sinks in anguish

Bel thinks of the wedding in Canaan

And prays that the Holy Virgin might soften

The Sinai brow of her father, Loevithan




### Funeral

It was on Pussy Willow Day, just as the bells were gloriously ringing

When the old dean from the steps cries hosanna to the Son

A pair of horses carried from the village across the sunny spring grass

A poor little dead girl



An orphan now carried by a farm boy on a rotting cart

That lovely child in a little coffin — it’s the little herding girl

Who each morning in the stable swept for the farmer

And complained to the calf



The little calf, terribly bawling, chewing along the choking path

From the stable gate it runs after the funeral cart of the child

As though a sister of the one who died

            Without the scent of sacrament, without baptism

Toward the old church tower



At the low church door the beast flinches at the blows

And the curse of devout Christians, those who here

            Kneel before the entrance



The beast silently

            In vain resists beneath the holy cross

And groans to Christ for help


It was on Pussy Willow Day, just as the bells were gloriously ringing

When the old dean from the steps sang hosanna to the Son

And the poor calf died of its own pain in the grass

With a gaze that, for the last time, pleaded for mercy



— Little shepherdess, there is no torment harsh enough to burn the wound away

Which from earthly love

                     We place into the darkness of graves

Remember this love one day

                  When from Christ the Lord there shall be

In paradise the judgment of man above the beast




### Consolation

Sidewalk, grey one, time built you

While bravely multiplying its own bones

Why, even then, had you already, for all of us

Not yet reckoned with the mighty of this world?



I tread upon you with my love every day

Amazed confessor

While the street gulps down my dream

In filthy screaming



Or only with time will we come to know

That it was necessary to suffer like you

You whom everyone merely tramples, spits upon

Out of weariness from hardship



Perhaps we will remain astonished

When you appear to us somewhere in heaven

And you will be a road in paradise

For those who perished of hunger upon you




When you become a rainbow reconciling worlds

And perhaps you already are, even today

Only we somehow cannot comprehend

That spilled blood could bear the color of blossoms

Like some seven-colored boundary meadow



### The Wayside Chapel at the Crossroads

It was on a great holiday at the place of holy torments

On a great holiday, it was at the wayside shrine

And you gazed into the land

You looked into the wide expanse

Listening deeply

Like a chapel no one has consecrated again

The rows of spruces did not bow along the road

With their banners

They did not bow, not for you

And did you even wish them to?

For no one ever knew you, silent as the grave

Snow whitened the hillside

Sprinkled with the tears of innocent children

Sprinkled for the burnt-out Christmas light

And gray crows flew low to the ground

Frightening your prayer

Pure as the breeze from the mountains

And I understood

I understood like snow understands fallen hands

those that burned

With an immense longing for a quiet altar

I went to read at the chapel at the crossroads

To the unconsecrated chapel I went to read

A remembrance for the dead

And your hands

Did not even tremble

When I took from them

Unclean, without confession, in sin

The paten with the host —

And your hands

Did not even tremble

Only angels in the heights sang victorious

Alleluia


### Falling Asleep

Did a butterfly flee? Ah, no

Whose curiosity was asking whose?

It is the mist spinning ringing ribbons

And it jingled

Against the gentle orchard of dozing eyelids — God’s rainbow



Did the lovely child play? It played? It no longer plays

It sees not, hears not, sees not — for the downpour of light

A magic swan has flown from the heavens into its eyes

And the meadow danced away into beauty —

The magic swan holds in its beak

a little key to the gate of paradise



Someone groans in anguish? The lovely child does not hear

The mother is a pious woman

and on a hot, sleepless bed

She pleads for God’s mercy

Thus her eyes are crossed in prayer, and her palm aches with pain

Which only sleeps with difficulty — and in the heights



Does it snow on the road to heaven? The prayers are sliding down

along the braid

A dreamy spider has wafted a web of peace



— Tell me, child, what bees are those in paradise

— The sleepers are falling asleep

— And that sound beneath the window?

— It is the crake…


### Death

To J. Mahen

Then let the rainy clouds descend from above

Upon this little hill of earth

When I shall be among the apple trees

Sleeping in their roots

And I know that day will come

So let it come whenever it may



Across the sky

Across the beautiful, clear sky

Ships will sail from distant bays

And there will be so many of them

That people won’t even say

Shadow

All will be attentive like a mother’s breath

And nothing will wound me



Then perhaps I’ll only be dreaming

As in paradise

And why not?

I’ve seen paradise so many times already

In quiet evenings after the Angelus bell


Everything will spin

But not like

Like when the world spins for the weary one

And falls

Everything will spin gently, like the great Earth

And before me my whole life will pass

Like soldiers returning from the hardest battle

On Christmas Eve

And from that moment I shall fall into a deep dream

Far, far back to my childhood



I will see my father leaning

Over my hot eyelids

I’ll hear my mother quietly weeping

My sister will play for me as when someone asks

“Where is my home?”

And in its wide rhythm

With a lingering gaze

Beautiful women will stroll past

Each of them will say something beautiful

As they always knew best how to say

There will be none of those heavy moments

Only the beautiful ones will remain


In the end, when I become drunk

On the returned life that I love

I will see my father with a towel

And I will be a three-year-old child



Father will walk carefully

Across the courtyard of my childhood home

He will walk so carefully

And suddenly he will stop at the corner



And I will suddenly lose my breath

As if I were three years old again

I will hear a snap

Father shoots a rat



And how, all of a sudden

A flame will burst forth

That will tell me all the secrets

I’ll blush, I’ll go pale

My heart will stop

And I will be

Also

Dead


Then descend, you rainy clouds from above

And let gentle rest accompany my memory



I will be that black earth
