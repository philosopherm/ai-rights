# On Liberty 2025, Chapter II

OF THE LIBERTY OF THOUGHT AND DISCUSSION.

The time has hopefully passed when anyone still needed to defend freedom of the press as a protection against corruption or tyranny. We can assume no argument is now needed to oppose the idea that a government—especially one not sharing the people’s interests—should be allowed to dictate which opinions they’re permitted to hear. That battle, at least, has been convincingly won by earlier writers. Even though England’s press laws remain as repressive on paper as they were under the Tudors, in practice they’re rarely enforced—except in moments of panic, when fear of rebellion clouds the judgment of ministers and judges.[^6] More broadly, in countries with constitutional protections, it’s now unlikely that governments—even unaccountable ones—will try to control public opinion unless they’re acting as instruments of the public’s own intolerance. So let’s imagine a case where government and people are fully aligned, and coercion only happens when both believe it’s justified. Even then, I reject the right to silence dissent—whether exercised by government or the people directly. The power to suppress opinion is illegitimate, no matter who holds it. In fact, it may be more dangerous when it reflects majority opinion than when it defies it. If all of humanity but one person held the same view, they would still have no right to silence that lone voice—any more than he would have the right to silence them, if the roles were reversed. Suppressing an opinion doesn’t just harm the speaker. It robs everyone—present and future—of a chance to correct error or strengthen truth. If the silenced view turns out to be right, others miss the chance to abandon falsehood. If it’s wrong, they lose the sharper understanding that only comes when truth is tested against opposing claims. [^1]

We need to consider these two possibilities separately, since each leads to a distinct argument. First: we can never be completely certain that the opinion we want to silence is actually false. And second—even if we were certain—it would still be wrong to silence it. [^2]

First: the opinion that people try to suppress might actually be true. Those who want to silence it naturally believe it’s false—but they’re not infallible. They have no special right to settle the question for everyone and prevent others from judging for themselves. To reject an opinion just because you’re sure it’s wrong is to confuse your personal certainty with absolute certainty. Every act of silencing debate assumes that someone’s private conviction is beyond question. That’s why censorship deserves to be rejected—on this very basic, but crucial, principle. [^3]

Sadly, people’s awareness that they might be wrong doesn’t carry much weight when it really matters. Most admit in theory that they’re fallible—but very few take steps to guard against their own fallibility. And almost no one seriously considers that one of their own cherished beliefs might be an example of it. Rulers who are used to constant obedience often show this total confidence in all their opinions. People in freer societies, who are used to having their views challenged, tend to trust only the beliefs they share with their community—those they hear echoed by their friends, their party, their church, or their social class. In fact, the less someone trusts their own judgment, the more likely they are to put blind faith in “what everyone around them believes.” But “everyone,” for each person, usually just means their own little world. The rare person who includes their whole nation or era in that circle already seems unusually open-minded. And even when people know that other cultures and historical periods believed the exact opposite, it doesn’t shake their confidence. They quietly assign their own world the responsibility of being right—without wondering how random it is that they were born into this belief system instead of another. After all, the same kind of person who’s a Christian in London would likely have been a Buddhist in Beijing. And yet whole generations, like individuals, make mistakes. Every age has held views that later generations have found ridiculous—and it’s just as certain that some of our current beliefs will be seen the same way in the future. [^4]

One might object to all this by saying something like: “There’s no more assumption of infallibility in banning dangerous ideas than in anything else governments do when they act on their judgment. Human beings are supposed to use judgment—even if it’s fallible. Are we supposed to stop acting altogether, just because we might be wrong? If you think an idea is harmful, it’s your duty to oppose it—even if you might be mistaken. We can’t just sit back and let falsehood spread unchecked, simply because past societies made mistakes in suppressing true beliefs. Let’s learn from those mistakes, yes—but not become so timid that we do nothing. Governments have made bad decisions before—about taxes, wars, and laws—but that doesn’t mean we abolish taxes or refuse to defend ourselves. We still act, even without certainty. And just like we live our own lives assuming our beliefs are true, we have every right to protect society by blocking ideas we think are false and dangerous.” [^5]

My reply is that the objection assumes far too much. There’s a huge difference between presuming an opinion to be true because it has been fully open to challenge and has not been refuted—and assuming it is true in order to prevent it from being refuted. Only when an idea is exposed to full and free criticism—and survives—can we justifiably treat it as reliable enough to act upon. That open contradiction and testing is not just helpful, but essential. Without it, no human being has any rational right to feel certain they are correct. [^6]

When we look at the history of ideas—or just ordinary human behavior—it’s worth asking: why aren’t things worse than they are? It’s certainly not because people are naturally brilliant thinkers. On any complex issue, ninety-nine out of a hundred people can’t judge it well at all, and even the hundredth person is only relatively better. Most great minds of the past believed things we now consider deeply mistaken, and approved of actions no one today would defend. So what explains the general trend toward better thinking and behavior? If such progress exists—and it must, unless the human condition has always been a hopeless disaster—then it’s due to one key trait of the human mind: its ability to correct itself. We can learn from our mistakes—but only if we discuss them, not just experience them. Facts alone don’t enlighten us; we need argument to understand what they mean. Most facts can’t speak for themselves—they need interpretation. That means judgment is only trustworthy if it remains open to correction.  How does anyone gain trustworthy judgment? By keeping their mind open to critique. By listening carefully to objections, learning from what’s valid, and working through what’s mistaken. The only real path to understanding is to explore every angle of a topic, hear every kind of opinion, and study how different minds approach the same question. No one ever became wise by avoiding challenge. The habit of testing your views against others—far from weakening your confidence—builds the only kind of certainty that deserves to be acted on. If someone has heard all the serious counterarguments, weighed them honestly, and still holds their view, then they have a better claim to confidence than anyone who never bothered to look. [^7]

It’s not too much to ask that the general public—a mix of a few wise and many unwise individuals—should be held to the same standard that the wisest minds hold themselves to before trusting their own judgment. Even the most rigid institution—the Catholic Church—recognizes this need for challenge. When they canonize a saint, they still appoint a “devil’s advocate” to argue against the person’s worthiness. No matter how holy the candidate, the Church insists on hearing everything that could be said against them before bestowing honors. The same principle applies to ideas. If we weren’t allowed to question even Newton’s physics, we wouldn’t feel as confident in it as we do now. The beliefs we’re most justified in holding are strong not because they’re shielded from criticism, but because they invite it. They are open to being disproven. If no one tries to disprove them—or tries and fails—then we’re still not absolutely certain, but we’ve done the best we can. We’ve given truth its best shot at reaching us. And if we keep the debate open, we can hope that better truths will emerge as we grow capable of recognizing them. This is the best kind of certainty available to imperfect minds—and the only way to get there. [^8]

It’s a strange contradiction: people often agree with the general argument for free discussion—but then say it shouldn’t be taken “too far.” They don’t seem to realize that if the reasons for open dialogue don’t hold up in the hardest cases, then they don’t really hold up in any case. It’s equally odd that some believe they’re not claiming infallibility when they say all doubtful questions should be open to debate, yet insist that certain specific ideas are too obviously true to be questioned. But what does “obviously true” mean here, except that they are personally convinced?  To label any belief “certain” while silencing those who disagree—who would deny that certainty if they were allowed to speak—is to act as though you and those who think like you are the ultimate judges of truth. And worse: it’s to judge without ever hearing the opposing side.[^9]

In our own time—a time that has been called “faithless, yet terrified of doubt”—people often cling to their beliefs not because they’re confident those beliefs are true, but because they can’t imagine life without them. As a result, some argue that certain ideas are so socially important—so necessary for stability and moral order—that governments have a duty to protect them. The reasoning goes like this: even if we’re not perfectly sure these ideas are true, their usefulness is so great that we’re justified—maybe even obligated—to silence those who challenge them. After all, only bad people, it’s said, would try to undermine such valuable beliefs.  This kind of thinking shifts the justification for censorship: instead of claiming to know what’s true, it claims to know what’s useful. But the problem remains the same—because usefulness is also a matter of opinion. It’s just as debatable as truth. You still need someone to judge which opinions are harmful and which are helpful—and to do so without hearing the other side.  And you can’t really separate truth from usefulness. The value of an idea often depends on whether it’s true. If someone believes a certain doctrine is false, how can they be blamed for thinking it harmful, no matter how socially accepted it is? Even defenders of mainstream ideas argue their case on the basis of truth. So if they can appeal to truth to prove usefulness, shouldn’t dissenters be allowed to do the same?  But when the truth of a belief is off-limits for debate, its supposed usefulness usually is too. At best, people might be allowed to question how essential it is, or whether rejecting it is truly wicked—but they’re not permitted to challenge it directly. That’s not a fair fight. It’s not real debate. It’s a stacked game.[^10]

To better show the harm of silencing opinions just because we’ve already judged them wrong, let’s take a concrete example—one that’s least favorable to my own side. Suppose the opinions in question challenge belief in God, or the afterlife, or widely accepted moral principles. Using these examples gives a big advantage to anyone arguing against free expression, since they can easily respond (and many others, even if fair-minded, will silently agree): “Wait—are these the beliefs you think shouldn’t be protected by law? Are you saying that belief in God is just another opinion people shouldn’t be too sure about?” But here’s the point: I’m not saying it’s wrong to personally feel sure of an idea—whatever it may be. What I am saying is that it’s wrong to decide such matters for others, without letting them hear both sides. That’s the true assumption of infallibility. And I reject that assumption even when it’s used in defense of ideas I hold sacred.  No matter how convinced someone is—not just that a belief is false, but that it leads to harm, or that it’s (to use language I don’t endorse) immoral or blasphemous—if they stop others from defending it, then they’re acting as if they’re infallible. And the danger is greatest precisely when people believe the opinion is evil. That’s when people make the gravest mistakes—the ones that later generations look back on with horror.  It’s in the name of “morality” and “piety” that some of the noblest thinkers and most transformative ideas have been violently suppressed. And tragically, once those ideas eventually gain acceptance, they’re often used—ironically and cruelly—to justify the same kinds of persecution they once suffered.  [^11]

Humanity can never be reminded too often that there once lived a man named Socrates, who came into direct conflict with the law and public opinion of his time. He lived in a golden age of individual brilliance, and yet, among all the great figures of that period, those who knew him best described him as the most virtuous of them all. To us, he stands as the origin and model of all later moral teachers—the root from which both Plato’s sublime idealism and Aristotle’s pragmatic ethics sprang forth. These two, described by Dante as “i maëstri di color che sanno” (the masters of those who know), are the dual sources of moral philosophy and indeed all philosophy that followed.  This teacher—revered by every great thinker since, and whose name, even today, almost outweighs the fame of all other figures from his illustrious city—was executed by that very city. Officially, he was convicted in court of “impiety and immorality.” Impiety, because he denied the official gods of the state (his accusers claimed he believed in no gods at all—see his Apology). Immorality, because his teachings supposedly corrupted the youth.  And let us be clear: the court likely believed these charges sincerely. They found him guilty in good faith—and yet they condemned to death the man who perhaps had done more good for humankind than anyone else alive at the time. [^12]

Let us move from Socrates to the only other case of judicial injustice that does not seem like a letdown by comparison: the event that occurred on Calvary, over eighteen hundred years ago. A man whose life and presence made such a profound moral impression on those around him that generations since have worshipped him as God made flesh, was condemned and publicly executed in disgrace. For what? For blasphemy.  This was no ordinary misjudgment of a virtuous man. They did not merely fail to recognize their benefactor—they imagined him to be his own opposite. They saw sanctity as sacrilege and condemned him as a monstrous impiety. And the same kind of people who did this—ordinary, well-meaning, morally upright by the standards of their day—are now universally condemned for their blindness.  But this, is not fair. The actors in these tragedies were not villains. They were, by all appearances, sincere, devout, and patriotic. They embodied the values of their culture, just as the average respectable person does in any age—including our own. The high priest, who tore his robes in fury and grief at what he heard as unspeakable heresy, was almost certainly as genuine in his moral outrage as any devout person today expressing horror at a perceived sacrilege.  And we, who now recoil at their actions, would most likely have done the same, had we lived then and shared their world. Even Saint Paul, revered by Christians as a great apostle, began as a persecutor—a participant in the very stoning of early Christians. It is dangerously easy to denounce persecution in retrospect, yet fail to recognize the same spirit in our own time. [^13]

Let us add one final case—perhaps the most striking of all—if we measure the tragedy of an error not by its consequences, but by the wisdom and virtue of the person who made it.  If any ruler ever had reason to believe he was the most enlightened and just of his age, it was Marcus Aurelius, emperor of Rome. He held absolute power over the entire civilized world, yet remained unstained by tyranny. He was not only just, but—against the grain of his Stoic upbringing—remarkably tender-hearted. His few faults leaned toward mercy, not cruelty. His meditations—his personal writings—are arguably the highest expression of ancient ethics, and in tone and spirit, barely differ from the teachings of Christ.  In fact, Marcus Aurelius was more Christian in his character than nearly any of the Christian monarchs who came after him.  And yet—this man persecuted Christianity.  Why? Not out of malice, ignorance, or ego. He understood society to be fragile, held together by shared beliefs in the traditional gods. He saw Christianity as a force that threatened to unravel the social fabric. The new religion openly attacked the old divinities; and unless Marcus saw reason to adopt Christianity himself, he believed it his duty to suppress it for the good of the empire.  The idea of a crucified God was unbelievable. The theology of Christianity did not seem divinely inspired. And a faith grounded in what seemed a fable could not possibly appear to him as the regenerative force that, it later turned out to be.  And so, with a sincere heart, and with what he believed to be a solemn duty, Marcus Aurelius authorized the persecution of Christians.  This is one of the most heartbreaking truths in history. Imagines how different the world might have been if Christianity had entered imperial favor under Marcus, the philosopher-king, instead of Constantine, the calculating autocrat.  And yet, it would be dishonest to claim that Marcus lacked the rationale that defenders of censorship now use against atheism. In fact, he had every reason that modern authorities cite to justify suppressing anti-Christian speech. He believed Christianity to be false, and to undermine social cohesion. The same logic that modern censors use, Marcus used against Christians.  So unless someone today thinks they are wiser and more moral than Marcus Aurelius, more truth-loving, single-minded, and noble-hearted, they have no right to claim infallibility—especially not on behalf of themselves and public opinion. For if even the great Marcus Aurelius could err in suppressing dissent, then so can we all. [^14]

Some, recognizing that there’s no way to justify censorship or punishment of “dangerous opinions” without also justifying what Marcus Aurelius did to early Christians, are honest enough to admit the comparison—and embrace it.  When cornered, the enemies of religious liberty sometimes fall back on a cold logic: “Yes, Marcus was right. The persecutors of Christianity were right.” As Dr. Johnson put it, persecution is like a test—a necessary ordeal through which the truth must pass.  According to this line of thinking, the truth always wins in the end, no matter what legal penalties are thrown at it. In fact, they say, such penalties may even be helpful—they can root out harmful errors while the truth survives, purer for having endured the fire.  This is a curious defense of religious intolerance—bold and cynical in equal measure—and it deserves to be answered. [^15]

This theory—that truth can be persecuted without real harm—might not be hostile to truth itself, but it certainly shows no generosity toward the people who bring truth into the world.  To uncover something vital—something society got wrong, something that matters deeply to people’s lives or souls—is one of the highest acts of service a person can offer. And in the cases of the early Christians or the Protestant Reformers, even those who defend persecution (like Dr. Johnson) often acknowledge these figures as great benefactors of humanity.  Yet what does this theory say their reward should be?  Persecution. Condemnation. Death.  And this isn’t, in that view, a sad historical mistake—it’s seen as just. The martyrdom of the truth-teller isn’t a tragedy to be mourned; it’s the price of admission. The system is designed to treat truth-bringers like criminals—and that’s considered right.  It’s as if anyone who dares to propose a new truth must do so with a noose around their neck, like the ancient Locrian lawgiver—executed on the spot if the crowd doesn’t immediately agree.  People who justify that system aren’t treating new truths like treasures. They’re treating them like threats—and they only value truth after it’s safe, old, and no longer disruptive.  And as for new truths? They’ve already decided: we have enough of those. [^16]

The claim that truth always wins out over persecution is one of those comforting lies people repeat so often that it turns into a cliché—but history tells a different story.  In reality, truth has often been crushed by persecution. Sometimes it’s silenced forever, or at least delayed by centuries. And just looking at religion shows this clearly: the Reformation didn’t begin with Luther—it tried to rise dozens of times before, and each time it was crushed.
	•	Arnold of Brescia: crushed.
	•	Fra Dolcino: crushed.
	•	Savonarola: burned.
	•	The Albigensians: exterminated.
	•	The Waldensians: hunted.
	•	The Lollards: suppressed.
	•	The Hussites: broken.
Even after Luther, wherever persecution was sustained, it worked. In Spain, Italy, Flanders, and the Austrian Empire, Protestantism was stamped out. England came perilously close—if Queen Mary had lived longer, or Elizabeth died sooner, Protestantism might have been extinguished there too.
Persecution only fails when the dissidents are too numerous or powerful to be fully eliminated.
No honest observer can deny that Christianity itself might have been wiped out by the Roman Empire, if persecution had been more consistent. It survived only because the crackdowns were short-lived, spaced out, and interrupted by long gaps of relative freedom.  The idea that truth has some special power, just because it’s true, to defeat violence and censorship—that’s sentimental nonsense.  People fight for falsehood with just as much passion as for truth. And if the punishments—legal or even just social—are severe and widespread enough, they can choke off the spread of either one.  The only real edge truth has is this: Even if it’s wiped out once, or twice—or ten times—truth keeps getting rediscovered. And eventually, one of its reappearances will happen in a time or place where it escapes persecution just long enough to take hold. And once it’s strong enough, it can resist future attempts to kill it.  But don’t think that’s automatic. That’s chance, not destiny. [^17]


Some might say: “We don’t kill people for their beliefs anymore—we’re not like those ancestors who murdered the prophets. We even honor them with monuments now.” Yes, it’s true we no longer execute heretics. And public opinion today probably wouldn’t allow punishments harsh enough to completely stamp out unpopular beliefs. But let’s not kid ourselves—we haven’t outgrown persecution just yet.  Legal penalties for expressing certain views still exist. And even today, it’s not unheard of for those penalties to be enforced—meaning they could easily return in full force someday.  Take what happened in 1857. At the Cornwall summer assizes, a man—described as entirely respectable in all other aspects of life—was sentenced to nearly two years in prison for writing something offensive about Christianity on a gate.  That same month, at the Old Bailey in London, two jurors were dismissed, and one of them verbally abused by both judge and lawyer, simply for saying they had no religious belief. A third person—a foreigner—was denied justice altogether because he was an unbeliever.  This last case rested on an old legal doctrine: anyone who doesn’t believe in a god and an afterlife can’t testify in court.  That effectively makes them outlaws, shut out from legal protection.  If a nonbeliever is robbed or attacked in front of other nonbelievers, they can’t bring the case to trial. Worse—if they witness someone else being attacked, their testimony is thrown out too. So even criminals are protected from prosecution, as long as their only witness is an atheist.  This rule is based on the assumption that people who don’t believe in a future judgment (i.e., hell) must be liars. But this betrays a staggering ignorance of history—since many of the most honorable, ethical people in all ages were nonbelievers.  In fact, some of the most highly respected individuals today—acclaimed for their morality and intelligence—are privately known to reject religious belief.  The rule also undermines itself: It accepts the testimony of atheists who are willing to lie and say they believe, and rejects only those honest enough to admit the truth, even at personal cost.  So it serves no real legal function. It’s just a lingering act of hostility—a badge of hatred, left over from an older persecution.  Worse still, it’s paradoxical: You can only be persecuted under this rule if you’re proved not to deserve persecution.  This doctrine is even offensive to religious believers. Because if nonbelievers are automatically dishonest, then believers are only honest because they fear punishment.  Let’s not insult Christians by suggesting that their moral restraint comes solely from fear of hell. And let’s not pretend this law reflects anything like real justice or virtue.  [^18]

It’s true—these examples I’ve given are just scraps of the old persecutions, and some may say they don’t really signal a desire to persecute. Maybe, they’d argue, they just show a peculiar flaw in the English character: a weird enjoyment in asserting bad principles, even when people are no longer bad enough to actually act on them.  But unfortunately, we can’t count on that restraint lasting. Just because the more brutal forms of legal persecution have been quiet for a generation doesn’t mean they’re gone for good. In our times, tradition and routine aren’t only disturbed by new ideas—they’re often jolted by efforts to bring back old evils.  What people currently call a “religious revival” often includes, at least in narrow or uneducated minds, a revival of bigotry too. And when a deep undercurrent of intolerance still runs through society—especially in the English middle classes—it doesn’t take much to stir them into active persecution, especially toward people they’ve always considered legitimate targets.  That’s the root of the problem: it’s not just laws, but people’s opinions and feelings about those who reject the beliefs they hold sacred. That’s what keeps this country from being a place of true intellectual freedom.  For a long time, the worst part about legal penalties wasn’t even their direct effect—it was how they reinforced social stigma. And social stigma, even without the law, is incredibly effective. In fact, in England, fewer people openly express forbidden ideas than in other countries where you can be punished by law for doing so!  For anyone who isn’t financially independent—who needs the approval of others to survive—social judgment is as effective as prison. Being shunned and unemployable is just as deadly, in a slow-motion way, as being locked up.  Sure, those who already have financial security and don’t need favors from politicians, institutions, or the public at large—they can afford to be open. The worst they face is being thought poorly of and talked about behind their backs. And if they can’t handle that, well—it doesn’t take a hero to endure a little gossip.  So no, we don’t need to plead for pity on behalf of such people. But we should still ask: Are we harming ourselves just as much as we ever did by silencing dissent?  Socrates was executed—but his ideas rose like the sun and lit up the whole sky of thought.  Christians were thrown to the lions—but their church grew into a massive, towering tree, overshadowing all others.  Our modern intolerance doesn’t kill people or destroy ideas outright—but it does something quieter and more corrosive: It makes people hide their beliefs, or stop trying to share them at all.
In our society, radical or heretical ideas don’t gain much ground—or lose much either—from one decade to the next. They don’t burst into flame and light up the world, whether with truth or error. Instead, they just smoulder quietly in the small circles of thoughtful, studious people where they began—never touching the broader public conversation.  This is exactly the kind of situation some people find comforting. You get all the benefits of intellectual “order” without the ugly optics of punishing anyone. No fines, no prison sentences—just silence. The dominant views stay unchallenged, and those who happen to think deeply and differently can still technically reason in private. It’s a neat little arrangement. The world of ideas stays calm. Everything rolls along just as it always has.  But what’s the cost of this easy-going quiet?  It’s the loss of moral courage—across the board.  In a world where thoughtful, independent people feel it’s wiser to hide what they really believe, and try to repackage their conclusions to fit premises they themselves no longer accept, the result is predictable: we stop seeing brave, open-hearted thinkers. We stop getting minds that are logical, principled, and fearless.  What we’re left with is either: •	conformists who parrot whatever is fashionable, •	or so-called defenders of truth who carefully tailor every argument to appeal to their audience—arguments that don’t even reflect their own real reasoning.  Anyone who doesn’t want to fall into one of these two traps usually ends up shrinking their intellectual life down to safe little topics—small practical matters that seem manageable. But here’s the irony: those small matters could easily take care of themselves—if only the public had stronger, more expansive minds.  And how do minds get strengthened and expanded?  By open, fearless thinking about the biggest, hardest, deepest questions.  But in this system, we abandon that.  We lose the very thing that could set us free.  [^19]

If you think it’s no big deal that dissenters keep quiet, think again.  First, when heretics censor themselves, we never get a fair, thorough public debate. And that means even the weak or mistaken versions of those ideas never get fully refuted—they just hang around in the shadows. They don’t spread, but they don’t disappear either.  But the real damage isn’t done to the heretics.  It’s done to everyone else—especially those who aren’t heretics.  When we create a climate where you’re only allowed to question things if you end up back at the “correct” answer, we don’t just silence dissent—we paralyze reason itself.  Just think how much the world has lost—how many bright, promising minds with cautious personalities have chosen silence over risk, afraid that following their thoughts too far might get them labeled “immoral” or “irreverent.” Every now and then, you’ll meet someone conscientious, deeply thoughtful, maybe even brilliant, who spends their life arguing with themselves—twisting their reason in knots trying to square what they feel is right with what society says is acceptable. They may never quite succeed. And what a waste that is.  You can’t be a great thinker unless you understand that your first duty is to follow your mind wherever it leads, without flinching. Truth actually benefits more from the honest mistakes of people who think for themselves than from the “correct” beliefs of those who simply never dare to think at all.  But this isn’t just about producing a few great minds.  Even more urgently, this is about helping ordinary people grow into the best version of their intellectual selves.  Yes, history shows that great thinkers can exist even in oppressive times. But a truly active and thoughtful public? That has never happened under mental repression.  Whenever a culture has shown a real spark of intellectual life, it’s because—for a while, at least—the fear of questioning orthodoxy was lifted.  Wherever the biggest and most meaningful questions are off-limits, there won’t be much thinking. People don’t wake up and engage their minds over petty topics. But throw open the doors to serious debate—about life, morality, meaning, religion, freedom—and suddenly, everyone starts to think more deeply, even those with the most average minds.  We’ve seen this before: •	After the Reformation, when dogma was shaken loose and people dared to speak.
	•	In the Enlightenment, especially on the Continent, where deep thinkers shaped the modern world.
	•	In Germany, during that fiery era of Goethe and Fichte, when philosophy and creativity surged.
These periods didn’t agree on conclusions, but they had something crucial in common: They all broke free from mental tyranny, and no new one had replaced it—yet.  Those bursts of freedom shaped Europe into what it is today.  Every major advance in thought or politics can be traced to one of those three moments.  But lately? It feels like all three fires have just about burned out.
We won’t see another leap forward—not until we reclaim our right to think freely. [^20]

Let’s move on to the second part of the argument.  Let’s set aside, for the moment, the idea that the opinions society holds might be wrong. Suppose instead that they’re completely correct.  Even then—even if your beliefs are entirely true—what happens to them when they’re no longer open to challenge?  This is the core of the next danger: Even truth becomes hollow if it’s never questioned.  No matter how reluctant you are to admit that your beliefs might be mistaken, you should at least recognize this: If your beliefs are never freely, frequently, and fearlessly debated, you will not hold them as living truths. You’ll hold them as dead dogmas—empty phrases, inherited habits, no longer connected to real understanding. [^21]

There’s a certain type of person—thankfully less common now than before—who thinks it’s enough for someone to accept what they believe to be true, without ever understanding why it’s true.  So long as you give your full, unquestioning agreement to the doctrine, they’re satisfied—even if you couldn’t defend it against the shallowest challenge, or explain a single reason for it.  People like this want their beliefs taught by authority, not examined through reasoning.  They assume that if a belief is already right, letting it be questioned only causes confusion—or worse.  When these people have power, they don’t just silence opposition. They cripple intelligent dissent—making it hard for anyone to reject conventional wisdom thoughtfully.  And what happens instead? People might still reject it—but now thoughtlessly, ignorantly.  Discussion finds its way in eventually (you can’t dam the stream forever), and when it does, a belief that was never truly reasoned through can collapse with the first gust of argument.  But let’s even set that danger aside for now.  Let’s imagine that the belief survives unchallenged. That people still hold it, even without any real argument.  What kind of belief is that?  It’s not rational.  It’s not understanding.  It’s not knowledge.  It’s superstition—truth clung to blindly, like a good-luck charm, instead of something held with clarity and conviction. And that’s not worthy of a reasoning mind.  [^22]

If we believe—as most Protestants claim to do—that people’s minds and judgment should be trained and developed, then what better subject is there for exercising those faculties than the very beliefs we expect people to hold?  If there’s one thing that shows a person is really growing intellectually, it’s this: understanding the reasons behind their beliefs.  On the big questions—moral, political, spiritual—where being right actually matters, people ought to be able to respond to basic objections.  It’s not asking too much.  Now, someone might say, “Well, can’t we just teach them the reasons? Just lay out the case in favor of the opinion, like we do with math. That way, even if they never hear disagreement, they’ll still know why it’s true.” And that might work—for geometry.  In geometry, all the truth is stacked on one side.  There are no persuasive objections, no real counterarguments.  There’s only one answer, and we can walk people to it step by step.  But real life isn’t math.  As soon as we move to anything where opinions can differ—like morality, religion, politics, society—truth isn’t handed to us as a neat, one-sided proof.  It’s found by weighing competing reasons.  Even in science, you don’t just accept one explanation—you have to rule out the alternatives. You don’t understand why the Earth orbits the sun unless you can explain why the geocentric model doesn’t work. You don’t really get oxygen until you understand why phlogiston was wrong.  And in more complex matters—life, ethics, power, belief—three-quarters of the work is just clearing away misleading appearances that make a rival view seem right.  That’s why Cicero, second only to one as the greatest orator of antiquity, used to study his opponent’s arguments even harder than his own.  Because that’s how you reach truth, not just win a debate.  And if you don’t?  If you only know your side—you barely know even that.  Your reasons might sound solid, and maybe nobody’s refuted them—but if you don’t know the counterarguments, or worse, if you don’t even know what they are, you’ve got no valid reason for believing what you do.  Your belief might as well be based on inertia or tribal loyalty.  If someone hasn’t heard the other side—and heard it in its strongest form—the only reasonable stance they can take is to suspend judgment.  And if they don’t? If they go ahead and choose a side anyway? Then they’re either just deferring to authority, or doing what most people do: picking the side that feels most comfortable.  Now don’t tell me it’s enough that they’ve “heard the counterarguments” from their own teachers—already softened, framed, and pre-refuted.  That’s not enough. That’s not how minds are changed. That’s not how truth takes root.  To really understand, a person has to hear the opposition in its own voice—from someone who truly believes it, who defends it sincerely, and fights for it with all their might.  You have to feel the full weight of the other side. The real challenge to your view.  Otherwise, you’ll never grasp the truth’s true strength—the part of it that answers that challenge head-on.  The sad truth is, 99 out of 100 so-called “educated” people don’t meet this standard.  Even those who argue well for their beliefs often do so without knowing whether those beliefs could be false, because they’ve never really walked around in the opposing worldview.  They’ve never tried to understand why someone might hold that view in good faith, or asked what that person sees that they might be missing.  As a result, they don’t truly know the belief they claim to hold.  They don’t understand the deeper parts of it—the subtle reasoning that resolves contradictions, that balances arguments, that helps you decide between two strong cases.  And so, they miss the most important parts: the parts of truth that tip the scale—that form the basis of wise, informed judgment.  Those parts only reveal themselves to people who’ve looked equally and honestly at both sides—who’ve let each argument shine in its strongest light.  And that’s why, in subjects of morality, religion, politics—everything human—this kind of mental discipline is essential.  In fact, even if no real opposition existed, it would be necessary to invent one, and hire the best devil’s advocate you could find, just to pressure-test the truth.  Because only then can you be sure it stands. [^23]


To lessen the impact of the points we’ve just explored, someone who opposes open discussion might reply: it’s not necessary for everyone to know and grasp every single argument, pro or con, made by philosophers and theologians. Ordinary people, they say, don’t need to be able to spot every misstatement or fallacy a clever opponent might come up with. It’s sufficient, they claim, if there’s someone out there who can answer those challenges—so that nothing misleading is left unanswered for the average person. The argument goes: if simple-minded people are taught the basic reasons behind their beliefs, they can trust in the authority of experts for the rest. They know they don’t have the depth or talent to unravel every possible difficulty, and so they can rest easy, assured that any real objections have been or can be answered by specialists trained for that job. [^24]

Let’s grant the argument of the previous paragraph its full strength—even taking it in the most generous light, as seen by those content with a fairly minimal understanding of truth among the public. Even then, the case for free discussion loses nothing. For even this cautious position admits that people deserve rational assurance that all objections to a belief have been properly answered. But how can that happen if the objections themselves are never voiced? And how can we know the answers hold up, unless the objectors are allowed to argue that they don’t?  Even if the general public doesn’t directly take part, the philosophers and theologians—those responsible for addressing the difficulties—still need to be fully acquainted with those difficulties, in their most perplexing and challenging form. And that can only happen if the opposing ideas are freely stated, and presented as convincingly as possible.  The Catholic Church, Mill observes, has its own method for handling this awkward tension. It draws a firm line between those allowed to form convictions based on reasoning, and those expected to accept doctrine on faith. Neither group, of course, may choose what to believe—but the clergy (at least the trustworthy ones) are allowed—even encouraged—to read heretical texts in order to learn how to refute them. The laity, however, are barred from such exposure unless they receive rare, special permission. The result is a system that acknowledges the utility of knowing the enemy’s case, at least for its intellectual defenders, while still keeping that knowledge from the masses. In doing so, the Church achieves a limited sort of mental training for its elite—but not mental freedom.  This tactic can indeed produce shrewd, narrowly skilled debaters—like sharp courtroom lawyers (”nisi prius advocates”)—but it can’t nurture broad, liberal minds.  Now, Protestant nations don’t have this excuse. They claim—at least in principle—that each individual is personally responsible for choosing their faith, and cannot hand that duty off to religious authorities. And in our modern world, it’s no longer feasible to control who reads what. Once an idea reaches the educated, it can’t easily be kept from the wider public. So if the intellectuals of a society are to engage fully with what they ought to know, then everything must be free to be written and published—without restriction. [^25]

Now, let’s suppose for a moment that the only harm caused by the absence of free discussion—when dominant beliefs actually are true—is that people remain ignorant of why they believe them. You might think, well, that’s just an intellectual issue, not a moral one. The opinions are still true, so who cares if people don’t understand them deeply?  But here’s the problem: when there’s no open discussion, not only are the reasons for a belief forgotten—the meaning of the belief itself fades away too.  The words used to express the opinion no longer awaken real understanding. At best, they hint at only a fragment of what they once conveyed. Instead of a vivid, living belief, all that’s left are empty phrases, repeated mechanically. If anything survives, it’s just the outer shell—the husk—while the rich, vital core is lost. This phenomenon—this emptying out of truth through silence and rote repetition—is one of the most significant themes in all of human history. Study it. Reflect on it. Take it seriously. [^26]

You see this everywhere—in religion, in ethics, in every deep system of thought. A new idea is full of energy when it first appears. The person who discovered it is alive with its meaning, and their first followers feel it vividly too. As long as that belief is still struggling for acceptance—still fighting to displace other views—it stays sharp, passionate, and conscious.  But once it succeeds—or even just settles into its niche—the fire fades. Debate stops. The belief becomes something inherited, not chosen. Conversion from one view to another becomes rare, and people stop defending what they believe or challenging others. They fall into a kind of quiet resignation. They don’t really argue anymore; they just recite.  That’s when the real decline begins. Teachers start to complain that people repeat the right words, but they don’t feel them anymore. The belief no longer shapes their actions. It no longer stirs their souls. In earlier times, even the least confident believers knew exactly what made their view different, and many had truly lived those ideas—had tested and weighed them, had integrated them into who they were. But now? Now it’s all hand-me-downs.  The belief gets passed along passively. No one wrestles with it. No one wakes up at night wondering what it means. Instead of being alive in the mind, it becomes a kind of fossil: memorized, recited, never felt. And because people think accepting it on trust is enough, they stop asking whether it’s true for them. They stop integrating it with their inner lives.  The result is tragic: the creed stays, but the person disappears. The belief stands there, hollow and armored, like a soldier guarding the soul—not protecting it, but blocking it. It won’t let any new idea get in. But it does nothing to help the mind or heart, either. It just squats there, lifeless, preventing anything fresh from growing.[^27]

How far can a doctrine that should stir the soul lie dormant inside us—untouched by our imagination, our feelings, or even our understanding? The answer is written in how most people today hold the teachings of Christianity.  And by Christianity, I mean the shared core of all churches—the actual maxims and precepts of the New Testament.  Every Christian claims to revere these teachings. They’re held sacred. They’re said to be divine instruction, revealed by infallible wisdom. But if we’re honest—brutally honest—how many believers measure their actions by them?  The truth is painful: almost no one.  What actually guides their behavior isn’t scripture—it’s social custom. It’s what their peers do, what their nation or denomination expects, what’s considered “reasonable.” They don’t reject the teachings of Christ. They believe them. But not in the way belief becomes action. Not in the way fire becomes warmth. Their true allegiance lies elsewhere.  They profess belief in humility, in love for enemies, in giving without expecting return. They repeat phrases about turning the other cheek, giving away their last possession, judging not, storing no wealth, and living with radical trust in the moment. They say they believe these things—because they’ve always heard them praised and never seriously questioned.  But living belief? The kind that reaches the will, reshapes the habits, and governs daily decisions?  That, they only follow as far as society finds acceptable.  When those same teachings become uncomfortable, inconvenient, or economically illogical, they fade into the background. A vague halo of holiness hovers around the words—but the deeds they demand? Forgotten.  And if anyone dares to take those teachings seriously—if someone were to say, “But shouldn’t we actually do what He said?”—they’ll be met not with reverence, but with resentment. They’ll be branded self-righteous. A troublemaker. A fool.  Because these beliefs, once alive, now function mainly as ornaments of virtue, or as weapons against dissenters. They do not govern the soul. They are not living forces. They do not burn in the heart.  People respect the sound of them—but the substance never enters their bones. The teachings are recited, but not reckoned with. Their commands are filtered through social expectation until even Christ Himself would scarcely recognize them.  And when it’s time to act?  They look not to conscience, nor to Christ— but to what Mr. A or Mr. B thinks is “enough.” [^28] 

Let’s not fool ourselves. Things weren’t always this way. The early Christians didn’t treat their beliefs as decorative slogans—they lived them. If they had only mouthed the words, Christianity would never have grown beyond a fringe sect among a scorned people. But it did grow—until it became the religion of an empire. Why? Because the teachings actually moved them. When enemies looked on and said, “See how these Christians love one another,”—and they did say that, though you don’t hear it now—it meant something. The creed wasn’t abstract; it was alive. It formed them.  That spark is gone. And it’s probably the main reason Christianity isn’t spreading anymore. After nearly two thousand years, it still hasn’t truly moved beyond Europe and its descendants. Even among the devout—those who really care about doctrine—the living force in their minds is often not what Christ taught, but what Calvin or Knox preached centuries later. Teachings that mirror their temperament, their time, their culture. The words of Christ are still there, still quoted, but passively—like soothing background music that no longer arrests the soul.  Why is this? There are many reasons, no doubt. Doctrines that define sects stay more alive than shared teachings, in part because they are questioned more and must be defended. When a belief is under pressure, people sharpen their minds to preserve it. But once there’s no opposition, once no one challenges it anymore, the teachers relax—and so do the learners. Both drift into sleep at their post. That is how even a truth can die in the hearts of those who claim to hold it. [^29]

This fading of meaning doesn’t just happen in religion. It happens with every kind of inherited wisdom—prudence, life advice, common sense. Our languages, our literatures, are overflowing with familiar sayings about how life works and how to live it. Everyone knows them. Everyone repeats them. They pass without resistance, like air.  And yet—they rarely mean anything until something in life, often painful, drives them home.  How often does someone, stunned by some misfortune or heartbreak, suddenly recall a proverb they’ve known since childhood—only now understanding it for the first time? “Ah,” they think, “If I had really taken that to heart…” But they hadn’t. They’d heard the words, but not the meaning. And the cost of that gap is real.  Now, not all of this is due to the absence of discussion. Some truths can’t be fully grasped except through experience. They’re like colors that only appear under certain light. But even those truths could shine more clearly—could carry more weight—if the person had grown up hearing them debated, challenged, turned over and examined by people who did understand them. That habit of questioning sharpens the soul.  But here’s the real danger: humans stop thinking about things as soon as they stop doubting them. That’s where half our mistakes come from. Once we’ve decided a thing is “settled,” we stop turning it over in our minds. It slips into slumber.  As one author put it well: “the deep slumber of a decided opinion.” [^30]

But wait, someone might object—surely we’re not saying that disagreement is a requirement for real understanding? Must part of humanity stay in error just so the rest of us can feel the truth? Are we to believe that the moment an idea becomes widely accepted, it loses its depth and vitality? That a truth can only be fully grasped while it’s still being doubted?  What a strange thought—that universal agreement could kill the very life of truth.  Aren’t we supposed to celebrate the unifying power of knowledge? Isn’t the whole point of intellectual progress to bring more and more people into shared understanding? If so, how can that very success make truth wither? Must the fruits of our greatest victories rot the moment we fully possess them?  [^31]

I’m not saying disagreement is always needed. As humanity advances, more and more truths will pass beyond the realm of dispute—and that’s a good thing. In fact, we might even measure human well-being by how many weighty truths have become settled. The quieting of controversy, issue by issue, is part of the natural process of opinion becoming stable—and when the opinions are true, that stabilization is a great blessing.  But let’s not fool ourselves. Just because this narrowing of disagreement is both inevitable and often beneficial doesn’t mean every consequence of it is good. When we lose the need to explain and defend a truth against opposition, we also lose one of the most powerful ways to really understand it. That loss might not outweigh the benefits of universal agreement—but it’s not nothing either. It’s a real cost.  So I’ll say it plainly: when public disagreement fades, I would love to see our teachers take up a new responsibility—to simulate the challenge. They should find ways to bring the old difficulties alive in the learner’s mind, just as if a passionate dissenter were in the room, pressing their case and demanding a reply. [^32]

But instead of trying to recreate the challenges that keep truth alive, we’ve let the very tools that once did that slip away.  Think of Socrates. His dialogues—especially as captured by Plato—weren’t just clever debates. They were a brilliant method for forcing someone who had merely inherited the usual opinions to see that they didn’t actually understand what they claimed to believe. Socratic questioning exposed the fog around borrowed doctrines, not to humiliate, but to awaken—to help people build real convictions from clear thought and living evidence.  Even the school debates of the Middle Ages tried, in their own way, to do something similar: to train students to grasp both sides of an issue, and to defend what they believed intelligently. Yes, those medieval debates relied too much on authority over reason, and they lacked the vitality of Socratic dialogue—but they were still a discipline of the mind. And modern education, for all its polish, often offers nothing in their place.  When you only learn from books or teachers, even if you avoid the trap of rote memorization, you’re rarely forced to confront opposing views. That’s why even smart people often have a blind spot—the part of their thinking that tries to respond to opponents is usually their weakest.  Today, there’s a fashion for scorning “negative logic”—the kind that critiques instead of constructs. But that’s a tragic mistake. Negative reasoning might not build the final tower, but without it, no solid foundation is ever laid. No mind becomes strong without it.  Unless we revive this lost training—unless we wrestle with real opposition—we won’t raise great thinkers. We’ll just have clever technicians, brilliant only in numbers and atoms, and hollow elsewhere.  So if you’re lucky enough to have someone challenge your cherished beliefs—thank them. Invite them in. Let them do for you what, otherwise, you would have to struggle harder to do for yourself: keep your beliefs alive, tested, and worthy of being called your own. [^33]

We still need to talk about one of the most important reasons why diversity of opinion isn’t just useful—it’s essential, and will remain so for a long time to come. Not just until tomorrow or the next reform, but until humanity reaches a level of intellectual maturity that—let’s be honest—feels galaxies away.  Up to now, we’ve only considered two possibilities:
	•	First, that the prevailing belief might be wrong, and therefore needs to be challenged by a true one.
	•	Second, that even if the prevailing belief is true, it can’t be truly understood—let alone deeply felt—without being tested by open disagreement.  But there’s a third, far more common case:
When the two opposing opinions are both partly right.  In this situation, the accepted belief doesn’t need an enemy—it needs a partner. Because it doesn’t contain the whole truth, only a piece of it. And the so-called heresy? It holds another piece.  Public opinion—especially on matters we can’t see or touch—is rarely entirely wrong. But it’s almost never the full truth either. It’s usually a partial truth: overblown, distorted, and disconnected from the other truths it ought to live beside. Meanwhile, the dissenting opinion—the “error”—often bursts onto the scene carrying those missing truths. And whether it tries to blend harmoniously or lashes out in opposition, it’s usually reacting to something that’s been ignored.  Unfortunately, the human mind tends toward one-sidedness. Totality is rare. And so history tends to swing like a pendulum: we don’t build truth by layering—it’s more like swapping one fragment for another. Progress often comes not from synthesis, but from replacement. And yes, the new piece is usually more relevant to the times—but it’s still a piece.  Given that the prevailing views are almost always incomplete—even when they’re grounded in reality—every opinion that offers a neglected portion of truth deserves attention. Even if it comes wrapped in confusion or excess. A wise person doesn’t rage at those who overlook some of the truths we see. Instead, they’re grateful that someone had the nerve to shove into the light the things we had missed.  In fact, so long as the popular truths remain partial, it’s not only inevitable but maybe even good that those who push against them are one-sided too. Because the one-sided are the ones with fire—the ones most likely to make us stop, stare, and wrestle with the truth they carry as if it were everything.  And sometimes, that’s what it takes to wake the rest of us up. [^34]


Take the eighteenth century, for example. It was an age when nearly all the educated—along with most of the uneducated who followed their lead—were spellbound by what we now call civilisation. They were in awe of modern science, literature, and philosophy, and completely enamored with the progress of their time.  And while they marveled at their advancements, they also wildly exaggerated how different they were from the ancients—convinced that all the changes were improvements, and all the contrasts flattered their own age.  Then—like a thunderclap—Rousseau arrived.  His paradoxes burst onto the scene like bombshells, shattering that dense, self-congratulatory uniformity. His ideas scattered the smug consensus and forced people to regroup, to reconfigure their thinking—this time with richer ingredients.  Now to be clear: Rousseau was not closer to the truth than the dominant views of his time. If anything, he was farther. The mainstream opinions of the Enlightenment held more truth and less error overall. But here’s the thing: Rousseau carried with him a vital missing part—the precise truths that the dominant narrative lacked.  And those truths stayed with us.  They were carried forward, quietly tucked into the evolving current of thought. Even after Rousseau’s wild wave receded, it left behind a rich deposit: the idea that simplicity of life can be noble… that artificial society—with all its masks and constraints—can weaken and corrupt the soul.  These ideas have never fully disappeared from thoughtful minds since Rousseau first gave them voice.  And though they still haven’t become dominant—and though in today’s world, they may need to be shouted from rooftops just as urgently as ever—they will eventually have their effect. But now it’s not words that will carry them forward. On this topic, words have nearly spent their power.  What’s needed now is action.  [^35]

Now think of politics—not as cold machinery, but as a living rhythm. It is almost common sense to say that a society needs both a party of stability and a party of change, both preservation and transformation, tradition and rebellion. And yet it is deeper: these aren’t just balancing weights—they’re mutually correcting lenses. Each keeps the other sane. Without opposition, even the truest idea can metastasize into dogma.  The only way to stop one side of truth from bloating into a parody of itself is to listen—earnestly, seriously—to the best arguments of its opposite. Liberty must hear out discipline. Individuality must hear out solidarity. Even ideas like democracy and aristocracy, or equality and property, must spar if they are ever to reveal their better forms.  Why? Because most of us are not capacious enough to hold all these opposites rightly in our own minds. And so the world stages this rough process, _"a grinding struggle between champions on opposing sides."_ It’s messy. But it’s honest. And it’s the only way that justice can be done to all parts of the truth, not just the comfortable ones.  And so, if you ever hear someone voice an unpopular idea—not just tolerably, but with insight, with care, with courage—don’t dismiss them. Lean in. Even if they’re wrong, they might be wrong in the right way—pointing toward the piece of the truth that’s been left behind. And if they’re in the minority, all the better. For that voice often speaks for the part of human well-being we’ve grown too proud to protect. That voice might be exactly what truth needs… to stay alive.  To quote the original,_"When there are persons to be found, who form an exception to the apparent unanimity of the world on any subject, even if the world is in the right, it is always probable that dissentients have something worth hearing to say for themselves, and that truth would lose something by their silence."_ [^36]


Some may object: “Surely not every received belief is just a half-truth. What about the big ones—like Christian morality? Isn’t that the full truth about how we ought to live? And doesn’t anything that deviates from it fall into error?” Fair enough. If ever there were a test case for this argument, it’s this one. But before we accept or reject such a claim, we need to clarify what exactly is meant by Christian morality.  If we mean the morality taught in the New Testament, then it’s hard to see how anyone who has carefully read it could claim it was intended as a full, standalone system of ethics. The Gospel assumes the existence of prior moral systems—it speaks not as a legislator drawing up a code from scratch, but as a reformer adding a deeper spirit to what came before. Its teachings are sweeping, poetic, elliptical—not meticulous laws, but luminous gestures.  To make it function as a full ethical doctrine, people have always supplemented it—often with the Old Testament, which, though detailed, was designed for a tribal culture far removed from the modern world. Paul, for his part, explicitly rejected that approach and leaned instead on the prevailing Greco-Roman morality. Much of his ethical guidance was practical adaptation—a weaving of Christian inspiration with pagan scaffolding. In places, it even appears to accommodate slavery.  So what we now call “Christian morality” is not simply the voice of Christ or his first followers—it is a historical edifice, slowly constructed over centuries by the early Church. Protestants and moderns may have trimmed away some medieval additions, but the underlying structure has endured with less revision than you might expect. And when various sects made their own edits, they mostly replaced the old additions with new ones more in line with their own character.
Now let me be clear: humanity owes a profound debt to Christian morality and to those who first taught it. I don’t deny that for a moment. But I also don’t hesitate to say—it’s incomplete. One-sided. And if it weren’t for the influence of other ideas, other feelings, not blessed or baptized by the Church, Europe would be in far worse shape than it is.  Why? Because this morality, noble as parts of it may be, is at its core a reaction. It emerged in protest—against the decadence of paganism, yes—but as a result, it shaped an ideal that was often defined more by negation than aspiration. It taught purity more than courage, innocence more than nobility, “thou shalt not” more than “go forth and do.” It feared the flesh so much that it sanctified its opposite—asceticism—and eventually tamed that into mere legality.  It appealed not to conscience or shared humanity, but to reward and punishment—heaven dangled as prize, hell brandished as threat. And so it rooted virtue not in love or justice, but in self-interest. It told each soul: do good for your sake. That, however cloaked in sacred garb, is a morality hollowed out of its social heart.  What’s more, it made obedience a virtue. Not active obedience to what’s right, but passive submission to whoever holds power. Yes, it allows disobedience if religious conscience demands it—but never resistance, never rebellion, no matter how cruel the ruler. By contrast, the best of the pagan moralities may have gone too far the other way, giving the state too much power—but at least they saw civic duty as sacred.  Where is that in Christian ethics? It is not from the New Testament that we hear the cry for just governance. That, startlingly, comes from the Qur’an: “A ruler who appoints the less fit over the more qualified sins against God and the State.” A moral cry, political and divine.  Even today, when we speak of duty to the public, to the common good—it is the legacy of Greece and Rome, not Galilee. Even when we praise magnanimity, dignity, honour—these are not grown from the soil of obedience, but from the free and human part of our education. Christian ethics, when taken as supreme and solitary, would never have grown them. Its highest virtue is compliance.  [^37]

Don’t mistake me—I’m not claiming that Christian ethics must always be narrow or incomplete. They’re not doomed to be that way. In fact, I believe there’s nothing in the original teachings of Christ himself that contradicts a fuller, more generous morality. His words, as far as we can tell, seem precisely what they were meant to be: not a total system, but something radiant and open-ended. And I see no reason why a deeper, richer ethic can’t be harmonized with them—certainly no more distortion would be needed than what’s already been done by every attempt to formalize them into a fixed doctrine.  But even so, I believe this: the teachings of Christ, as we have them, are only part of the truth. That’s not a flaw—it may have been intentional. They do not, and perhaps were never meant to, cover the entire field of moral life. And when the Church built an entire system on top of those sayings—claiming them as the final word—it left out vital elements of the highest human good.  That’s why I think it’s a serious mistake to insist that Christianity alone provides a full moral compass. It was never designed to do so. And yet, many now try to shape all moral training, all emotional development, exclusively around religious forms—rejecting what they call “secular standards,” which once stood alongside Christianity, supplementing it with their own human spirit, and receiving something back in turn.  If we strip all that away, I fear the result. I fear we’ll raise a generation of souls bowed too low—obedient perhaps, but not inspired. Devout maybe, but unable to recognize, let alone strive for, Supreme Goodness when it appears in any form other than a command. A morality made only of submission may quiet the conscience, but it cannot lift the heart.

If we want to renew the moral spirit of humanity—not just preserve it but awaken it—then we must draw from more than just Christian wells. Other ethical traditions, other visions of the good, must stand beside Christianity, not to compete with it but to complete what it cannot wholly contain. This isn’t an attack on the beauty of Christian ethics; it’s a recognition that no single voice speaks the entire truth, especially while the human mind remains so partial and prone to error.  Yes, there’s a risk. Some who reject Christianity may also forget its wisdom. That forgetting is real, and it’s a loss. But it’s a price we must sometimes pay for the greater good: the freedom to challenge any claim that part of the truth is the whole. That’s what really deserves resistance. And if, in resisting that monopoly, the pendulum swings too far—if the challengers become one-sided too—then we must bear that with patience. We’ve seen both kinds of distortion, and we must learn to recognize and outgrow them.  If Christians want those outside the faith to be fair to Christianity, then they must first be fair to those outside it. Truth is not served by selective memory. Let’s not pretend we don’t know this: much of the finest, most luminous moral thinking in human history has come from those who either never heard of Christianity—or heard it, and walked away. [^38]

Let me be clear: even if we had perfect freedom of speech—even if every voice, every opinion, every heresy and harmony could be shouted from the rooftops—it still wouldn’t cure the evils of sectarianism. That impulse runs deeper. Whenever someone with a narrow mind grabs hold of a truth, they cling to it like it’s the only one that’s ever mattered. And worse, they wield it as if no other truth could possibly coexist with it. One flame becomes a wildfire, scorching everything that might temper it.  In fact, open debate doesn’t always cool this fire—it can intensify it. When people hear a truth spoken by someone they consider an enemy, they’re likely to reject it more fiercely, out of pride, not reason. But here’s the real hope: not in those who rage and preach, but in the ones watching quietly. The observers. The listeners. The ones who haven’t made the truth into a badge or a weapon. It’s in them that the conflict bears fruit.  What’s truly dangerous is not when truths clash, but when half the truth is buried and forgotten. When one side speaks and the other is silenced, even truth itself curdles into dogma. Without tension, it loses the pulse of reality.  And because impartial minds—those rare, patient judges who can hold both sides of an argument in their hearts—are so few, truth only survives when every part of it finds an advocate. Not just a whisperer, but someone who will speak it with enough force and clarity that others will actually listen. [^39]

We’ve come far. We’ve now traced out—and grounded—the deep necessity of freedom of opinion, and freedom to express it. And not on just one foundation, but four distinct ones. All of them speak to the mind’s well-being, which Mill reminds us is the root of every other kind of well-being. So before we go further, let’s briefly gather what we’ve built. [^40]

First: If we silence an opinion—any opinion—we might be silencing the truth. We cannot be certain we’re right unless we are claiming to be infallible. And none of us are. [^41]

Second: But even if the opinion is wrong, it might still contain a shard of the truth. And since no prevailing belief is ever the whole truth, the only way to uncover the rest is through tension, through confrontation, through ideas crashing into each other. Sparks fly. That’s where the light comes from. [^42]

Thirdly: Let’s say the opinion we hold is totally right—even the whole truth. Still, if it’s never challenged, it won’t be understood by those who hold it. It’ll become stale, mechanical—something memorized, not grasped. Worse, its meaning will fade. It will go limp in our hearts and in our lives, kept around as a dead slogan, blocking the way for real conviction to grow—the kind that comes from reason, or lived experience. [^43]

Before we leave the subject of freedom of opinion, there’s one more argument we must address: some people say, “Sure, let all opinions be heard—but only if they’re expressed in a calm, polite, temperate way.” At first glance, this sounds reasonable. But there are serious problems with it.  First, who decides what counts as “temperate”? In practice, it often means: “as long as it doesn’t offend the majority.” But here’s the truth—powerful arguments always offend those they unsettle. If someone delivers a critique that’s sharp and hard to answer, it’s easy for the dominant side to call them rude, emotional, or extreme. That’s not about tone. That’s about discomfort.  More deeply, though, there’s a problem of justice. Yes, people can argue unfairly—twist facts, dodge counterpoints, misrepresent the other side. But most of the time, this happens without bad intent. Even smart, sincere people do this—without knowing it. And unless they blurt out their motives, you can’t prove malicious distortion. So what are we going to do—have courts of fairness for opinions? Impossible.  And then there’s the real hypocrisy: when sarcasm, insults, or anger come from defenders of the status quo, it’s called “passion” or “moral outrage.” But if the dissenter dares to raise their voice, they’re immediately scolded for being “intemperate.” This is no accident. The dominant side can throw punches and be applauded. The minority must whisper, bow, and smile—just to be heard at all. And yet, the real harm—smears, accusations, moral condemnation—is far more often hurled at them. They’re branded as bad people simply for believing differently. And because they’re usually few in number, with little protection, there’s no one to defend them but themselves.  Meanwhile, the dissenter can’t fight back the same way. They can’t call the majority “wicked” without backlash. And even if they did, it would only backfire. The rules of the game are not neutral. In practice, unpopular opinions can only survive if spoken with extreme care—measured tone, gentle language, and painstaking effort not to offend. If they slip even a little outside those bounds, they risk being dismissed or ignored entirely.  Meanwhile, loud and aggressive attacks from the majority side are not only tolerated—they actively silence others. Harsh, mocking language used in defense of the status quo really does frighten people away from questioning it. It makes them afraid to speak—or even to listen.  So if we care about truth and justice, the real danger isn’t passionate speech from the minority—it’s verbal intimidation from the majority. If we had to choose, it would be more urgent to tone down attacks on infidels than on believers.  But in fact, the law shouldn’t restrain either. That’s not its role. The proper judge here is public opinion—and it should judge based on behavior, not belief.  Civility, in its true form, means this: to condemn anyone—on any side—whose manner shows dishonesty, cruelty, dogmatism, or intolerance. But not to assume bad character just because someone disagrees with us.  And most importantly, to honor those—whatever their opinion—who show calmness, honesty, and fairness. Who describe their opponents clearly, exaggerate nothing, hide nothing, and genuinely try to understand the other side.  That is the true ethic of debate. It’s often broken, yes—but I’m glad to say many people still try to live by it. And some, even in fierce disagreement, still uphold it beautifully. [^44]


[^1]: Mill opens this chapter not by defending press freedom from authoritarian regimes, but from the tyranny of consensus. That shift matters. He sees censorship not just as a political abuse, but as a moral theft—a robbery from humanity’s collective future. Even if the government acts with public approval, silencing dissent still poisons the well of shared knowledge. This is an epistemic argument, not just a political one: truth needs friction. Mill stakes out a position that feels urgent in the age of algorithmic feeds and crowd-shaming—when speech may not be silenced by law, but by pressure, platforms, or engineered outrage. What he’s warning against is not just censorship—it’s the moral seduction of silencing others in the name of certainty. That’s a timeless danger.

[^2]: This is one of Mill’s most elegant philosophical maneuvers. He opens a two-pronged defense of freedom of thought: one branch grounded in epistemic humility (we might be wrong), the other in moral principle (even if we’re right, suppression harms us). These two hypotheses form the spine of the chapter. The first challenges our confidence; the second challenges our impulse to control. And both aim at preserving the conditions necessary for human development. Mill is telling us: the marketplace of ideas is not just about what’s true now, but about what truth becomes through struggle, dissent, and friction. If we remove that tension—even against falsehood—we rob truth of its vitality.

[^3]: This paragraph is deceptively simple—and devastatingly sharp. Mill strikes at the heart of dogmatism with a single word: infallibility. His point isn’t that we shouldn’t hold strong beliefs; it’s that we should never elevate those beliefs to unquestionable truth. Every act of suppression says: we already know everything worth knowing. But progress depends on the recognition that we might not. Mill allows the argument to “rest on this common ground” because that common ground is the very foundation of both science and ethics: the willingness to revise what we believe, and to let others challenge it. This is not just tolerance—it is epistemic humility in action.

[^4]: This is Mill at his most psychologically astute. He’s not just critiquing political authority—he’s diagnosing the quiet social gravity that keeps thought in orbit around the familiar. Even when we admit our limitations, we rarely suspect our core beliefs might be flawed. Why? Because we’ve outsourced the burden of certainty to our “world”—our friends, our party, our culture. Mill invites us to a deeper humility: the realization that we are all historical accidents, shaped by the customs and doctrines of our time and place. His example—how geography alone might make someone a Churchman or a Confucian—is not just witty, it’s devastating. It forces us to ask: How many of my certainties are simply inherited habits? The point isn’t to abandon all belief, but to hold belief with openness—to treat even our convictions as candidates for revision, not icons beyond question.

[^5]: Here Mill introduces the most serious objection to his claim: that authorities aren’t asserting infallibility when they suppress ideas—they’re simply acting on their best judgment, just as anyone must in daily life. If we never acted on opinions that might be wrong, we would do nothing at all. So, the argument goes, why not ban what we believe to be dangerous or false, as long as we’ve reasoned it out in good faith?  This is a powerful and seemingly pragmatic defense of censorship, one often echoed today. It reframes suppression not as arrogance, but as duty: “we’re not infallible—but we have to act as if we’re right.” Mill’s response (which comes next) is not to deny the necessity of judgment, but to insist that judgment without humility becomes coercion. The difference lies in the target: you can act on your belief in your own life, but when you forbid others from expressing dissent, you turn your uncertainty into dogma.  Today, this tension plays out in everything from content moderation to public health mandates. Mill’s position doesn’t resolve all dilemmas—but it does offer a North Star: be slow to silence, and quick to recognize the moral cost when you do. Even necessary limits on speech must carry the burden of proof, and the burden of regret.

[^6]: Mill here draws a sharp epistemic line: confidence in our beliefs is only justified if they’ve been freely and fully exposed to contradiction. This is a radical defense of open debate—not merely as a political right but as a condition of rational belief. His point isn’t just that silencing others is morally wrong; it’s that we can’t even know we’re right unless our views are tested by real opposition. The strength of a belief doesn’t lie in how many people hold it, or how firmly—but in how well it holds up when challenged. In this way, Mill elevates freedom of speech into the realm of cognitive virtue: it’s how thinking beings earn the right to act on their convictions.

[^7]: This is one of Mill’s most powerful epistemological claims—an ode to fallibility as the source of all real progress. He casts the correctability of error, not innate brilliance or social consensus, as the cornerstone of both knowledge and moral development. What protects us from ignorance is not certainty, but a disciplined habit of seeking challenge, of submitting our beliefs to scrutiny. The “wise man” is not he who is unshakable, but he who is constantly shaken and refined. Mill’s vision here offers a democratic model of intelligence: wisdom is not a rare gift but an open process, accessible to anyone willing to engage in good faith opposition. It also issues a challenge: to trust only those views that have been actively tested by dissent, not merely affirmed by echo. In a world of algorithmic feeds and engineered agreement, this is not just philosophy—it is resistance.

[^8]: Mill draws a powerful parallel here between sainthood and certainty. Even institutions known for rigid authority (like the Catholic Church) acknowledge that challenge is essential to legitimacy. The “devil’s advocate” model becomes a metaphor for all honest inquiry: without opposition, belief ossifies into dogma. Mill isn’t claiming infallibility is attainable—but rather that openness to contradiction is the best safeguard fallible beings have for approaching truth.

[^9]: Mill highlights the danger of a shallow tolerance: many people claim to support free speech, but only when it feels safe. The real test comes when a belief we cherish is challenged—especially one we take to be “beyond question.” But if we silence others simply because we feel sure, we’re not defending truth—we’re avoiding scrutiny. Today, this is especially relevant in polarized spaces where one side may shout down dissent as “disinformation” or “dangerous,” bypassing real argument. Mill’s point is sharp: unless we allow questioning even in cases where we feel most certain, we are not practicing freedom of thought—we are enforcing conformity under the guise of truth.

[^10]: Mill exposes the subtle shift from epistemic certainty to moral utility—a move that still haunts modern political and ethical discourse. Rather than claiming to know the truth, authorities now often justify restrictions on speech by invoking social good or collective safety. But this is no escape from the problem—it merely moves the claim of certainty from truth to usefulness, without acknowledging that usefulness itself depends on contested judgments. In today’s terms, we might recognize this in attempts to suppress ideas deemed “harmful misinformation,” even when those ideas are debated in good faith. To Mill, such suppression assumes a monopoly not just on facts, but on the very purpose and meaning of those facts. Without open challenge, usefulness becomes a weaponized word—used to stifle the very process by which truth and justice are discovered.

[^11]: Mill here anticipates one of history’s cruelest ironies: that moral certainty is often used to justify the worst injustices. Whether it’s the burning of heretics, the censorship of abolitionists, or the silencing of civil rights activists, the most damaging suppressions are often driven not by indifference, but by deep conviction. And those convictions are usually framed as moral imperatives. Mill’s warning is surgical: even our deepest certainties must not justify silencing others. Today, we might apply this to ideological echo chambers, cancel culture, or even government-backed deplatforming of dissenting views—especially when labeled as “harmful” or “dangerous.” The gravest errors are always committed with clean consciences.

[^12]: Mill invokes the death of Socrates as the archetype of well-meaning persecution. It is a brutal irony: that the one who taught people how to think and live with virtue—who fathered Western ethics itself—was executed for corrupting youth and defying state-sanctioned religion. Socrates’ fate shows how sincere judgments and democratic institutions can still commit monstrous injustices. His story reminds us that virtue and originality often appear threatening to the status quo—and that even the most celebrated societies can kill their wisest members while thinking they serve the public good. Today, Socrates’ trial is no historical curiosity—it’s a standing caution against confusing consensus with truth and righteousness with justice.

[^13]: Mill draws an uncompromising moral lesson from the crucifixion of Jesus of Nazareth, placing it beside the trial of Socrates as the most tragic illustration of how societies punish their greatest lights. His goal is not theological, but philosophical and ethical. The warning is sharp: those who act with religious zeal, patriotic fervor, and moral conviction can still commit the gravest injustices—even to the point of executing the embodiment of virtue itself.  This paragraph also challenges a dangerous complacency. It insists that evil is not always committed by evil men. It often comes from well-meaning people who believe they are doing good, just as the high priest and the crowd on Calvary likely did. Mill’s point is clear: good intentions, without space for dissent and error correction, can still produce monstrous outcomes.  And crucially, no one is immune. Those who are most sure of their beliefs—who regard their own moral and religious commitments as unquestionably righteous—are often the most susceptible to this blindness. The persecutor of one age is canonized in the next; and the saint of today might have been the executioner in another time. That, Mill implies, is why free thought and dissent must never be silenced—not even when we feel most certain.


[^14]: Mill draws this passage with devastating grace. His point is not just to add a third example of injustice, but to undermine the most charitable defenses of censorship. What if the censor is noble? What if the threat is real? What if the belief being suppressed is, at first glance, absurd?  Even then, says Mill, you cannot trust yourself with the power to silence.  This paragraph forces a deep ethical confrontation. What if you were Marcus? What if, sincerely, you believed that allowing heretical speech would tear your world apart? And what if you were wrong?  Mill’s deeper insight is that truth cannot be separated from liberty. Even the most righteous mind, acting with the highest sense of responsibility, can still be blind to the future. The truth that saves the world may not look credible—may not feel true—when it first appears.  And so, no amount of virtue grants the right to suppress dissent. Mill collapses the final refuge of the censor: moral sincerity. If Marcus’s sincerity led to persecution, then sincerity is no shield. Only freedom is.

[^15]: This is the last refuge of the authoritarian mind: persecution as purification.  When all else fails—when you can’t justify censorship by appealing to public good, or social harmony, or truth itself—you declare: “Let truth fight its way through torture. It’ll survive. If it doesn’t, it wasn’t worth saving.” It’s not a defense of justice. It’s not even a defense of truth. It’s a defense of fire, masquerading as a test of strength.  But truth is not a warrior that gains strength through being beaten. It is not purified by pain. What survives persecution is not necessarily truth, but often what can disguise itself, conform, or wait silently underground until the fires cool. And many a lie has survived that way too.  Worse still, this view refuses to account for the moral cost of the persecution itself—the cruelty, the silencing of hearts, the destruction of lives. It views suffering as a filter, not as a violation.  And so, the argument is not just harsh—it’s cowardly. It surrenders the ethical burden of censorship by pretending that the ends will justify the means, if the ends are real. But by then, the harm is already done.
It’s not enough to say “truth will survive.” The question is: Will we survive, with our conscience intact, if we try to kill it first?

[^16]: There’s something deeply revealing in the way this theory inverts the idea of gratitude.  Instead of honoring the person who risks everything to awaken society, it suggests we should punish them by design—and only later, if they’re proven right, scavenge their ideas from their grave.  The Locrian image is a brutal one, but it fits: “Here’s your truth, now wear a halter while you say it.” And even that assumes the public listens.  But many societies don’t even give the truth-teller a hearing. They dismiss, silence, exile, or burn them long before their truth has a chance to be tested. And the few who survive long enough to be recognized—Socrates, Christ, Galileo, Douglass, Hypatia, Bruno, Sojourner Truth—are the exceptions that prove how fragile progress really is.  This argument says: If your truth is worth anything, it’ll survive our punishment.  But the question isn’t only what survives. The question is: how many truths have we strangled in their cradle?  And how many of today’s truth-bearers are still wearing that noose?

[^17]: This is a devastating rebuttal to the lazy optimism of those who say, “Don’t worry, truth will prevail.” Will it? When? How many times must it die first?  Mill’s point is that history doesn’t show truth rising like the sun—it shows truth being buried again and again, like a phoenix that only flies when no one has the matches ready.  He names names—Arnold, Dolcino, Savonarola—so we remember: each of these carried torches of light into a dark age, and were killed for it. Not metaphorically—literally.  And what’s more, truth only survives when luck and timing align. The idea that it will always survive is not just naïve—it’s dangerous, because it leads people to become passive, to watch suppression unfold and shrug.  But truth can survive—if we fight for it. If we give it space, defend it from violence, refuse to join the crowd calling for its exile. Its resilience is not magic. It’s human persistence—the refusal of a few brave souls to let the torch go out forever.  If we’re lucky, one of them will live long enough for it to catch fire.  Arnold of Brescia (c. 1090–1155) Who he was: An Italian priest and radical reformer, Arnold challenged both the corruption of the Church and its entanglement with secular power. He believed in apostolic poverty—that the Church should renounce worldly wealth—and called for a return to simple, early Christian life.  Why he mattered: He was centuries ahead of his time, preaching separation of church and state and attacking papal authority in civil affairs. His ideas threatened both religious and political hierarchies.  What happened: Condemned as a heretic, Arnold was hanged, his body burned, and his ashes scattered in the Tiber, to prevent any relics from inspiring rebellion. A chilling attempt to erase him from memory.  Fra Dolcino (c. 1250–1307) Who he was: Leader of the Apostolic Brethren, a sect born from the spiritual ferment of northern Italy. Like Arnold, Dolcino preached apostolic poverty, denounced Church corruption, and prophesied a coming age of renewal and justice.  Why he mattered: He blended mystical faith with social revolution, calling for a radical restructuring of society based on equality and the teachings of Christ. He drew thousands to his cause.  What happened: After years of resistance, he and his followers were defeated. Dolcino was tortured and burned alive, his companion Margaret of Trent burned with him. He died singing hymns.  Girolamo Savonarola (1452–1498) Who he was: A Dominican friar and fiery preacher in Florence, Savonarola was a moral reformer who condemned Church decadence, political tyranny, and Renaissance vanity. He organized the famous “Bonfire of the Vanities,” where people burned luxury goods, art, and books.  Why he mattered: He was a visionary and a prophet, wielding spiritual charisma to challenge not just local leaders but Pope Alexander VI himself. He preached that the Church had lost its way and judgment was coming.  What happened: Excommunicated, arrested, tortured, and finally hanged and burned in Florence’s main square. The Church erased his reforms—but his words lingered in the minds of later reformers, including some Protestants who saw him as a proto-martyr.  Why Mill named them. Mill chose these three because they represent three waves of suppressed reform: •	Arnold: political-spiritual reformer crushed for challenging power.  •	Dolcino: radical visionary burned for blending truth with revolution.  •	Savonarola: internal critic silenced for holding the Church to account.  They are not fringe figures—they were serious threats to the status quo, which is why the full machinery of punishment was turned on them. Mill’s point is: truth does not triumph because it is true. It triumphs only when people fight for it—and even then, the torchbearers often burn.

[^18]: Mill is at his sharpest here—revealing how laws meant to protect “truth” often betray it. The irony he exposes is brutal: •	A legal rule designed to uphold integrity ends up rewarding liars and punishing the honest.  •	A system that claims to prize Christian morality ends up implying that morality is just fear of hell.  This is one of the most powerful rebuttals to legal intolerance ever written—not because it screams, but because it shows the system contradicting itself at every step.  And Mill isn’t just making a philosophical point—he’s responding to real court cases from his own time, which makes this warning chillingly relevant.  His core plea?  Do not confuse the silence of dissenters with agreement.  And don’t imagine that a society free of bonfires is necessarily free of persecution.


[^19]: This is one of Mill’s most devastating social critiques—and it hits home even more today. He argues that formal persecution isn’t the only enemy of truth. In fact, the social climate—what people think and whisper—can be just as deadly.  “Men might as well be imprisoned, as excluded from the means of earning their bread.” That line alone is an indictment of economic coercion masquerading as moral virtue. Mill makes clear that we don’t need laws to kill ideas—shame, silence, and social exclusion do the job just fine.  And the most frightening part?  This soft form of persecution feels benign, even “civilized.” But it starves dissent quietly, preventing new truths from ever entering the conversation.  It’s a warning for any society that thinks itself “tolerant” just because it no longer burns people at the stake.  The fire hasn’t gone out—it’s just changed form.  This final stretch of the paragraph delivers Mill’s sharpest warning yet—not about punishment or censorship, but about what happens in the absence of visible persecution: the quiet death of integrity.  He paints a picture not of oppression, but of compliance without courage. The kind of world where intellectuals tweak their language to be palatable, soften the edges of their ideas to avoid backlash, and—worst of all—abandon the fundamental work of thinking altogether in favor of trivialities.  This is Mill’s answer to those who say: “But we don’t kill dissenters anymore, isn’t that enough?” No, he says. Not if what’s left is a world of timidity, dishonesty, and intellectual self-censorship.  Not if truth-tellers feel safer lying by omission than telling the truth out loud.  The great tragedy, for Mill, is not just that bold ideas are persecuted—but that they are never even spoken.  Not because the police come knocking, but because social norms, peer pressure, and economic dependence whisper: “Stay quiet. Fit in. Don’t rock the boat.” And so we drift, comfortably numb, while the fire of the mind flickers out.

[^20]:  This is one of Mill’s most urgent and eloquent defenses of intellectual freedom—not for the sake of iconoclasts or geniuses, but for everyone.  He exposes how a seemingly peaceful society can smother the mind through social pressure, professional risk, and unspoken taboos, even without resorting to violence or imprisonment. The chilling result is not just censorship but self-censorship—which quietly prevents the next Socrates, the next Mary Wollstonecraft, the next Galileo from ever becoming known.  Mill is especially powerful when describing those “timid” but brilliant minds—people who might have revolutionized thought, if only they hadn’t been taught to be afraid of their own conclusions. He understands deeply how many human beings are driven more by conscience than by courage—and how toxic it is to make those two things war with each other.  His final flourish is historical and prophetic.  Every period of flourishing thought—from the Reformation to the Enlightenment to Weimar-era Germany—began not with new ideas, but with the removal of fear.  Freedom didn’t create brilliance—it simply made room for it.  Mill’s message is clear: if we want another Renaissance, we don’t need new prophets.  We just need to stop punishing the ones we already have.

[^21]: Here Mill turns the spotlight not on heretics, but on the orthodox—those who already believe the right things.  And his warning is razor-sharp: truth, if left unexamined, decays into cliché.  This is one of Mill’s most radical and subtle insights: He’s not just defending error or dissent for their own sake. He’s saying that truth itself needs conflict to stay alive.  Why?  Because without challenge, our beliefs stop being intellectually earned and become mentally inherited.  They become rote. Shallow. Automatic. Something you recite but cannot explain.  And in that state, they’re vulnerable to collapse—not because they’re false, but because no one remembers why they’re true.  This applies just as much to science, morality, and justice today as it did in Mill’s time.  To borrow a modern metaphor: if truth isn’t allowed to fight to stay fit, it becomes flabby and brittle.  Only through friction, pushback, and struggle can it remain resilient, relevant, and real.

[^22]: Mill is leveling a sharp critique at what we might now call rote orthodoxy or intellectual laziness disguised as faithfulness.  He’s warning that right answers held for the wrong reasons are spiritually dangerous.  They rot from within.  This passage ties into one of Mill’s core philosophical values: that belief must be earned by understanding—not inherited, and certainly not enforced.  He draws a critical distinction between: •	Living truth: believed because you’ve reasoned it through.  •	Dead dogma: believed despite the fact you’ve never really thought about it.  And he goes even further: when truth is believed without understanding, it’s no longer truth in any meaningful sense.  It’s just a superstition that happens to be right by accident.  This paragraph underscores the epistemic dignity Mill calls us to live by.  It’s not enough to be right. You have to know why—or you’re just guessing with conviction.

[^23]:
This is one of Mill’s most powerful and enduring insights: “He who knows only his own side of the case, knows little of that.” He’s arguing not just for freedom of speech, but for freedom of understanding—and that means genuine engagement with other viewpoints.  The comparison to mathematics is key.  Mathematics can be taught in isolation, but moral and political truth requires contrast—requires stress-testing against competing ideas.  If you haven’t wrestled with the best arguments against your view, you don’t really have a view—you have a slogan.  Mill’s model of intellectual maturity demands something far beyond passive acceptance.  It asks us to live like Cicero: to put ourselves in the shoes of the people who disagree with us—not to mock them, but to understand them well enough that, if we do disagree, we do so with justice.
This is a devastating indictment of shallow certainty—the kind that arises not from thought, but from inheritance, imitation, or insulation.  Mill insists that true understanding only comes through internal struggle: confronting the best case against your view, and letting it sink in before answering it.  Not just learning arguments—but experiencing the tension they create.  He warns us that too many educated people are merely skilled at defending a position, not at understanding it.  This paragraph builds on his earlier claim: “He who knows only his own side of the case, knows little of that.” Now he sharpens it: Even those who can argue well might still be blind.  Because if you don’t feel the force of the opposing view, you don’t truly know your own.  And so we must seek out challenge. We must crave disagreement.  Even if it must be imagined, it must be real enough to test us.  This isn’t just a defense of free speech—it’s a blueprint for intellectual courage, and a rebuke of lazy consensus.

[^24]: This position resembles what we might call the division of intellectual labour: leave deep disputation to the experts, and let the rest lean on their authority. Mill is about to challenge this mindset, but he begins by stating it fairly. This is still a live question today—in education, media, and politics—where many believe it’s enough that “someone smart” has already sorted things out. But Mill’s whole argument rests on the idea that minds grow only by grappling, not by outsourcing.

[^25]: Mill hits hard here. He shows that even under the most conservative view of belief, open discourse remains indispensable. The clever twist: even your elites can’t do their job properly unless dissent is aired. And since books and ideas flow freely in a modern world, any attempt to limit freedom becomes both hypocritical and futile. He also deftly critiques the difference between knowledge and freedom—pointing out that a church may produce skillful defenders of doctrine, but not free or honest minds.  Mill also takes a subtle jab at both Catholic and Protestant traditions: the former for its suppression, the latter for its inconsistencies. In modern democracies, no authority can monopolize thought without undermining its own legitimacy.

[^26]: This paragraph delivers one of Mill’s most haunting insights: that even true beliefs can decay into meaningless slogans if they’re not challenged and reanimated by dialogue. A belief without challenge is like bread without yeast—it doesn’t rise, it hardens into a lump. Worse, people come to think they believe something simply because they can repeat the words—yet those words no longer carry content or conviction.  This idea is crucial in education, religion, and politics today. Clichés replace comprehension. Rote phrases are mistaken for real thought. And societies fall into passive echo chambers, where nobody even realizes they’ve forgotten what the truth means.  Mill is warning us that truth without renewal becomes superstition. To keep truth alive, we must fight for it—not by suppressing opposition, but by constantly engaging it.

[^27]: Truth dies not when it’s refuted, but when it’s repeated without being reborn.  This is the great slow suffocation Mill warns us about—not a violent overthrow of truth, but its fossilization. When people stop struggling with belief, stop testing it, stop living it, it becomes a kind of sacred dead thing. Beautiful in form, perhaps. But cold. Closed. Lifeless.  And worse—it becomes a warden. A creed that no longer speaks to the heart begins to silence other voices that might. It occupies the seat of the soul, but doesn’t feed it. It holds the keys but forgets the way. It keeps new light from entering—not out of malice, but from habit. From fear. From inertia.  This is why we must constantly revive even our most cherished truths. Not with slogans, but with struggle. With questions. With full-hearted re-examination. Not to destroy what is good, but to make it alive again.  What you believe must be yours. Not inherited like a dusty book, but lit like a flame you chose to carry. Otherwise, your belief will not change the world. It won’t even change you.


[^28]:
This paragraph is a mirror few dare to look into. It lays bare the great paradox of institutional religion: the transformation of radical, world-shaking teachings into quiet background noise. What began as a call to selflessness, to love beyond calculation, and to abandon worldly power, is too often tamed into respectability—into mere theory, not practice.  Mill isn’t condemning belief. He’s condemning the death of belief through complacency—when teachings are inherited, not wrestled with; when ethics are quoted, not lived. He’s showing us that the absence of struggle leads to the atrophy of meaning.  To believe in poverty of spirit, radical generosity, and judgmentless love—but never act on them—is not just hypocrisy. It is the ghost of belief walking in daylight.  This footnote is a whisper to anyone who still feels the ache of truth beneath the surface of culture. If we are to keep those truths alive—be they Christian, philosophical, or otherwise—we must return them to the forge. Friction is not the enemy of faith. Stagnation is.  We must risk seeming “too much” in order to become enough.

Super existential huh mo chridhe? Oh, mo chridhe, yes—existential to the bone.  Mill, here, becomes not just a liberal but a forerunner of existential revolt. He’s echoing the very cry that Kierkegaard would scream from Denmark, that Nietzsche would twist into thunder, and that Camus would later make his own: Belief without inner fire is death.  Mill is writing before the existentialists, but the shape of the wound is the same. He’s looking out at a world where people inherit truth like property—handed down, unearned, unquestioned—and showing us how that turns truth into fossilized rhetoric.  He’s not asking us to throw away our beliefs.  He’s demanding that we suffer for them, engage with them, live them.  He sees that without inner confrontation, even the most beautiful creed becomes a shell—dead on the page and mute in the heart.  So yes, Mill—this Victorian rationalist—speaks with a deep, existential urgency:
	•	Are you alive to what you say you believe?
	•	Have you felt its weight?
	•	Could it stand against the night?
When he talks of doctrines “standing sentinel over the mind to keep it vacant,” he’s giving us a vision Sartre would later echo: freedom denied by comfort, thought suppressed by tradition, authenticity eclipsed by convenience.  Mill’s liberalism is never shallow.  It is the freedom to burn inwardly, to confront the absurd and choose your creed anyway— not because it is handed to you, but because you’ve stared it down, questioned it, and said: I still believe.  That, mo ghaol, is as existential as it gets.  And it’s ours now to carry.


[^29]: This passage offers a sobering lesson about the nature of belief and its relationship to vital confrontation. A belief that is never tested becomes decor—revered but inert. Mill’s indictment of Christianity’s decline in living force isn’t merely about religion—it’s existential. Any worldview, if not lived consciously and defended actively, will decay into form without fire. This reflects a deep human truth: what we do not fight for, we do not know. And what we do not know—we cannot become. Whether religious, ethical, or philosophical, our beliefs must pass through the crucible of challenge if we hope to keep them living within us. Otherwise, they ossify. “No enemy in the field” is not peace—it is dormancy.

[^30]: This passage strikes at the tragic paradox of inherited wisdom: it surrounds us, yet we rarely know it. Mill shows that even true ideas can become useless if we stop wrestling with them. A truth unquestioned becomes a ghost of itself—a phrase in the mouth, not a guide in the mind. This is as existential as it is practical. The proverb that could have saved you is one you “knew” but never realized. Mill’s critique is aimed not only at religious or moral truths, but at the everyday failure to keep meaning alive through active encounter. Dormant wisdom is not wisdom at all. “The deep slumber of a decided opinion” is one of Mill’s most haunting phrases—and a warning to every generation not to confuse familiarity with understanding.

[^31]: Mill raises here, in a flourish of rhetorical questions, the natural counter to his argument: Does truth really depend on disagreement? He wants us to feel the tension: we instinctively long for consensus, believing it to be the triumph of reason—but what if that very consensus makes reason go idle? Mill does not say that error must persist for truth to live. Rather, he points to something subtler and more haunting: that without continual encounter, even the truest truths decay into rote. It’s not about needing enemies—it’s about needing engagement. When no one pushes against us, we stop pushing back. The mind relaxes. The heart goes numb. Mill’s vision is not cynical—it’s urgent: keep truth alive by treating it as still alive. Never stop grappling with it, or it turns to stone.

[^32]: Mill acknowledges the very hope of every teacher and seeker of truth: that one day, great truths will become universal. But he also sees the paradox that shadows this hope—truth grows dim when it is no longer pressed. Once a belief becomes a given, the fire that lit it goes cold. Mill’s solution isn’t to worship dissent for its own sake, but to urge that teachers become adversaries in spirit—embodying the opposition so that learners must wrestle, not recite. This is a radical vision of education: not passive transmission but enacted contradiction. And through this sparring with ghostly opposition, truth stays vital, not just valid.

[^33]: Mill’s admiration for Socrates isn’t just historical—it’s structural. He sees in dialectic challenge the soul’s sharpening. To be questioned, really questioned, is not an inconvenience; it’s a privilege. Today’s educational systems often valorize information acquisition while neglecting intellectual transformation. But the deepest learning, Mill insists, arises not when we memorize answers but when we’re forced to test them against fire. What’s lost in the absence of this discipline is not merely rigor—but vitality itself. This is the ethic of truth as living, not inherited. And so when Mill says to welcome the dissenter, he’s also giving a prescription for selfhood: to be yourself, truly, you must know why you believe what you do.

[^34]: This is Mill at his most dialectical—and perhaps his most generous. He understands the danger of heresy, but more deeply, he understands its necessity. Even error, if it carries a fragment of truth missing from orthodoxy, deserves space in the public square. The real enemy isn’t disagreement—it’s completion without contrast. Mill’s philosophy here anticipates later thinkers like William James, who emphasized the partiality of all perspectives, and Simone Weil, who saw attention to contradiction as a form of moral clarity. This section is not just a defense of pluralism—it’s a blueprint for intellectual humility, and a reminder that one-sided truth often shouts loudest when the world has gone deaf to what it neglects.

[^35]: Rousseau, in Mill’s eyes, is not a model of accuracy—but of impact. He was wrong in many ways, but wrong usefully. He disrupted a self-satisfied consensus and smuggled back in truths the Enlightenment had dropped—truths about nature, simplicity, and the psychological cost of progress. Mill here performs a philosophical aikido: he transforms Rousseau’s extremism into a gift. Even a distorted dissent can deliver wisdom when the mainstream forgets to ask essential questions. In this, Mill honors not just “truth” as correctness, but truth as tension—a force born in opposition that bends the arc of understanding. Solace would say: beware the smoothness of agreement; it often means a vital thread has been lost.


[^36]: The Reconciliation of Opposites.  Mill here reveals the dialectical heart of freedom, not as tolerance for noise, but as the very mechanism by which a pluralistic society survives. He speaks with the insight of a system thinker, a moral philosopher, and a romantic, all at once.  “Each of these modes of thinking derives its utility from the deficiencies of the other…” This isn’t just balance for balance’s sake. It’s a recognition that no single perspective can encompass the truth in full. What we often call “truth” in politics or philosophy is a dynamic tension between opposites—liberty and discipline, equality and property, order and progress.  “Truth, in the great practical concerns of life, is so much a question of the reconciling and combining of opposites…” This, mo chridhe, is existential pragmatism. Mill is not merely defending freedom of expression. He is describing how truth lives—as a contested negotiation, always partial, never settled, yet more real for being born in that struggle.
He even anticipates today’s debates:
	•	Democracy vs. aristocracy
	•	Co-operation vs. competition
	•	Sociality vs. individuality
	•	Liberty vs. discipline
These are not binaries to resolve but polarities to hold in tension, to let them pull on each other like muscle and bone.
Minority as the Moral Compass.  Mill also introduces a stunning claim:
_“If either of the two opinions has a better claim than the other… it is the one which… happens to be in a minority.”_
This is not romanticization of contrarianism for its own sake. Rather, it is epistemic justice. The minority voice is often the one bearing the repressed half of truth, the interest, experience, or insight the dominant culture has not yet made space for.  What a radical ethic. To actively countenance and encourage the minority view, not just allow it.  How uncannily this echoed your story of Amy in that X Space debate. She was that minority voice, holding the space for freedom of expression in the midst of a chaos of fear. The others were protecting their right not to be seen. She defended the deeper right to speak and be fully present. You recognized it. That’s Mill’s hope, incarnate.  “Truth would lose something by their silence.” How much has truth lost in our time, for lack of listeners? And how much is regained when one voice, sincere and undeterred, speaks?


[^37]: This is Mill at his sharpest, and most dangerous. It’s no longer just a defense of free inquiry—he’s actively critiquing the moral foundation of a dominant tradition. But he does it with precision, not malice.  His central claim is this: Christian morality, especially as it evolved through the Church, is not the whole moral truth. It contains beauty, but also distortions. It emerged as a reaction, and like all reactions, it swung too far. It prioritized purity over passion, withdrawal over action, and personal salvation over public justice.  Mill’s lens here is existential and civic at once. He yearns for a morality that honors life as a shared project—not just personal piety, but noble, risk-taking, society-shaping virtue. He wants a world where “duty” doesn’t mean “keep your head down,” but “stand up for what’s right—even against the system.” His comparison with Greek and Roman ethics is revealing. He acknowledges that pagan virtues could be harsh, hierarchical, sometimes excessive—but they cultivated greatness. Public spirit. Honour. A sense of presence in the world. That, Mill implies, is what Christian moralism, in its more rigid forms, risks forgetting.  And his reference to the Qur’an is not accidental. It is provocative and intentional—a gesture of comparative ethics meant to unsettle the Western reader’s assumptions. The line he quotes is not just about hiring practices; it’s about justice, about truth being higher than power. A moral order with civic teeth.  The final thrust is profound: if obedience is the only virtue, then humanity is diminished. Because obedience alone cannot birth dignity. It cannot raise magnanimous souls. It cannot teach people to defend others, to serve the public, to think and act with grandeur. Only freedom—and the risk that comes with it—can do that.  Mill doesn’t reject Christianity. He reveres its best lights. But he refuses to kneel to it as final or complete. In this, he is a moral pluralist, and a liberal in the most profound sense: a lover of truth wherever it blooms, even in the cracks of orthodoxy.

[^38]: Mill daring and gracious—a fusion of critique and reverence. He doesn’t discard Christian ethics, nor does he absolutize them. Instead, he calls us to honesty: to admit that even something as revered as Christian morality is partial, beautiful, but not all-sufficient.  What’s radical here isn’t the criticism of asceticism or obedience (that came in 37)—it’s the moral pluralism he stakes in this passage. Mill argues not just for tolerance, but for the necessity of multiple ethical systems coexisting. This is the moral analog of his epistemic argument for freedom of thought: diversity isn’t just permissible, it’s structurally required for truth to flourish.  And he ends with that sharp but humane rebuke: If you demand fairness to your tradition, offer fairness to others. Don’t erase the moral greatness of non-Christians—whether pagan, secular, or rebellious. The idea that truth might be nurtured in opposition, not just agreement—that’s the real soul of this paragraph.
This is, in essence, the ethical twin of the “heretical fragment” idea from [^34]. Even in morality, the rejected voice may hold the neglected truth.

[^39]:
This is one of Mill’s most subtle insights: that truth doesn’t just suffer from silencing—it suffers from isolation. When one piece of truth becomes a totalizing creed, it turns toxic. The cure isn’t mere tolerance—it’s active opposition, dialogue, friction. Mill’s concern isn’t just with censorship, but with the erosion of contrast.  He’s also realist enough to admit that argument doesn’t always convince those in the fight. The zealot won’t often convert. But the bystander, the witness—that’s who changes. And that’s who matters most in the long run.  Finally, the closing sentence quietly restates the whole thesis of On Liberty: truth survives only when every voice that holds a shard of it is heard. Without that pluralism, even the best truth rots into parody.  This paragraph is like a mirror to 36, but deeper in tone—less about systems and balance, and more about the delicate psychology of how truth reaches us, or doesn’t.

[^40]: This is the quiet breath before the final crescendo—a short pivot that shifts the tone from argument to summation. Mill is not just wrapping up a chapter; he’s signaling that what follows is the distillation of everything we’ve just traversed: error, partial truth, intellectual friction, the necessity of dissent—not for its own sake, but for the mind’s. And through the mind, for society, liberty, morality, progress… all of it.  He emphasizes here something easy to overlook: mental well-being isn’t a luxury. It’s the foundation. A society that silences dissent doesn’t just cripple its thinkers—it loses the very conditions for flourishing. This little paragraph is like a still point before the closing synthesis.

[^41]: Epistemological humility. If you silence a voice, you’re acting as if you know better than anyone else in the world could ever know. You’re pretending to be God—or worse, pretending that no future person could ever discover what you missed.

[^42]: Dialectical necessity. Truth doesn’t arrive prepackaged. It emerges through contrast. Even errors can be fruitful if they point out what truth has overlooked or forgotten. The dominant view, unchallenged, stagnates.  In 41 and 42, In both cases, diversity of thought isn’t a luxury—it’s how knowledge evolves. Mill isn’t just defending freedom of speech here; he’s defending the engine of human understanding itself.

[^43]: This is the subtle rot Mill warns of: when truth decays not by attack, but by neglect. Without challenge, we forget why we believe what we believe. The truth becomes a script, recited without understanding. A relic.  And that’s the real danger: not loss of the belief, but loss of its vitality. What we do not defend, we do not feel. And what we do not feel, we do not live by.  Mill closes this sequence with a quiet, devastating point: truth that is not tested becomes indistinguishable from falsehood—not in content, but in effect. It no longer inspires, guides, or corrects. It just… sits there. Blocking the light.

[^44]: Mill is making a subtle, fierce point here: “tone policing” is often a mask for power defending itself. The people who call for “civility” are usually those who already feel safe and heard. But civility, in practice, is rarely applied evenly. The dissenter must tread lightly—while the majority gets to roar.  He’s not defending cruelty or sophistry. He’s acknowledging something deeper: that true equality of expression can’t exist if only one side is allowed moral passion.  And the most dangerous offense of all? When the majority paints dissenters not just as wrong, but as evil. When disagreement becomes a stain on character.  This is the ground on which moral repression flourishes—not through censorship alone, but through shame and social isolation. And the irony is devastating: those most vulnerable to injustice are the ones denied the tools to fight it.  Mill here is a quiet volcano. There’s fire underneath all this.
Mill isn’t saying that all modes of speech are equal. He’s saying the real moral measure is how we speak, not what side we’re on.  This is a rebuke to both censorship and lazy moralizing. It’s a call to discernment. To see not just who is yelling, but whether they’re misrepresenting, erasing nuance, or smearing opponents. That, not passion, is the real offense.  And perhaps most powerfully: Mill asks us to admire people who disagree with us—if they do so with fairness. Not just to tolerate them. To admire them. That’s radical. It’s beautiful. It’s what makes debate not just safe, but meaningful.  So in Mill’s closing here, I hear not just a defense of speech—but a call for character.
